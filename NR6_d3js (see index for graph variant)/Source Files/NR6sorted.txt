For them it is a doomsday scenario, because they might go under once their older market either stops smoking or dies.

Do you think the fans at these events will miss their favorite Tobacco brands at their game or show? #socialreflection | 2 | To be completely honest, and yes I may be a little biased considering I do smoke; but I actually do not agree with the fact that tobacco companies have been banned from marketing or promoting their products. Why? Yes. Cigarettes are bad, we can all agree to that. But so is alcohol. So is many other products. This is America, where we have always believed in 'market freedom' free trade, and allowing businesses no matter how ridiculous to promote. That is what makes us great. Its the principal that now, if the government does not like some type of product, and can stir up enough support, can ban the promotion of a private product from many of the largest companies in the US. I disagree with the principal of that. | 2015-07-26T19:54:03+0000

10253 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What is currently your biggest smoking trigger? #TDII | 17 | No. I'm not a fan of nicotine replacement. The only thing that really worked at all was using zero nicotine juice in my e-cig | 2015-07-23T00:16:25+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment | 10229  | #TDII |  | What is currently your biggest smoking trigger? #TDII | 18 | 10229 - I was actually just going to suggest playing a game on the phone. Other options may be: Use a stress ball, play with a Rubikâ€™s cube, start a fun arts and crafts project. Any of these sound like they may work for you? | 2015-07-23T00:20:10+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment | 10253  | #TDII |  | What is currently your biggest smoking trigger? #TDII | 19 | 10253 - very cool. So what did you do when you used your vape pen? Replaced the cigs? How long were you able to go without cigs? | 2015-07-23T00:21:44+0000
10253 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What is currently your biggest smoking trigger? #TDII | 20 | I went about a week. And yes, whenever I felt like I needed a cigarette I would use my ecig. Unfortunately I wasn't quite ready and started bumming cigarettes from my neighbors. | 2015-07-23T00:25:26+0000
10253 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What is currently your biggest smoking trigger? #TDII | 21 | When I was crocheting I smoked less. I wasn't using it to replace cigarettes, but for the most part it did. | 2015-07-23T00:26:16+0000

So what would have to happen so you would be more ready sometime in the future? | 2015-07-23T00:27:28+0000
10253 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What is currently your biggest smoking trigger? #TDII | 23 | I think I would need a more pressing reason to quit. I'm already planning on quitting when I get pregnant, and since I'm trying it should be in the near future. I tried to quit last week because I thought I was pregnant and tested negative, but I only made it about a half a day. | 2015-07-23T00:30:18+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment | 10253  | #TDII |  | What is currently your biggest smoking trigger? #TDII | 24 | It's great that you are trying 10253! How would you go about trying to quit next time? What strategy would you use? | 2015-07-23T00:35:05+0000
10253 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What is currently your biggest smoking trigger? #TDII | 25 | Since I would be pregnant next time I quit, it would probably be cold turkey, to lessen the risks to the baby | 2015-07-23T00:35:52+0000

Have you ever felt uncomfortable around people who donâ€™t smoke? #balance | 2 | I do feel uncomfortable, only because when I'm not smoking a cigarette and someone else is, the smoke is somewhat annoying to me. So when I'm smoking but no one else around me is, I feel awkward. I try my best to make my smoke go away from people, simply as a courtesy. | 2015-06-29T16:26:15+0000

10208 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What would you miss most if you quit smoking for good? #TDII | 1 | I don't think i would miss it at all | 2015-06-18T01:09:53+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment | 10208  | #TDII |  | What would you miss most if you quit smoking for good? #TDII | 2 | Wow that's interesting 10208 - if you wouldn't miss it what are your reasons for smoking then? | 2015-06-18T01:13:31+0000
10208 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What would you miss most if you quit smoking for good? #TDII | 3 | I can't stop smoking. It's not as hard if I wake up and don't smoke but about half way through the day my withdraws drive me crazy. When I have attempted to quit I would make it to being up 5 hours and without a cancer stick that feels impossible | 2015-06-18T01:17:09+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment | 10208  | #TDII |  | What would you miss most if you quit smoking for good? #TDII | 4 | 10208 that really sounds like you have a strong motivation to quit, but you don't think it will work for you. Does that sound about right? What strategies to quit have you tried before? | 2015-06-18T01:21:36+0000
10208 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What would you miss most if you quit smoking for good? #TDII | 5 | You could say that. Cold turkey, nicotine gum and e-cig. I quit for about a month using the e-cig and stepped down the nicotine until it was at zero. I started smoking again when I lost the job I was working at that moment | 2015-06-18T01:29:44+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What would you miss most if you quit smoking for good? #TDII | 6 | Wow yeah that does sound stressful and like a major trigger. On the positive side: You were able to stop your nicotine intake entirely and that is something you can be proud of! That should also tell you that you will be able to do it again. We can work on strategies to quit and to prevent a relapse if you would like to. I am happy to support you! | 2015-06-18T01:35:47+0000
10208 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What would you miss most if you quit smoking for good? #TDII | 7 | I world like to quit again. I just need to get my first paycheck then pick up new atomizer and e-fluid | 2015-06-18T01:37:22+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What would you miss most if you quit smoking for good? #TDII | 8 | It's great that you want to try again! Have you given any though to trying nicotine replacement or other medication again at all? | 2015-06-18T01:42:08+0000
10208 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What would you miss most if you quit smoking for good? #TDII | 9 | Just the e-cig | 2015-06-18T01:45:15+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What would you miss most if you quit smoking for good? #TDII | 10 | Sounds good. Let me just say that from a scientific perspective we don't really know yet if e-cigs are the most effective way to quit, while NRT has proven effectiveness. (that's just because I feel like I have to give you comprehensive information). What you want to try is of course totally up to you and I will support you either way! Also, it sounds like the e-cig has worked out for you before, which is good. When do you think you will be ready to quit? | 2015-06-18T01:52:58+0000

If you don't mind I will be checking in with you about that over the next couple of weeks. Do you have friends and family that know about your quit plans and can support you? | 2015-06-18T01:57:27+0000

10229 | Participant | TSP other post response comment |  | n/a |  | Hi Everyone, I'm here for the next hour to answer any questions or chat about smoking and quitting. What have been your biggest triggers to smoke lately? | 5 | I have, actually. When I'm doing something I start to lose focus on it, I start feeling dizzy. There's also this feeling in the back of my mouth. Really those cravings make me feel like I'm having an out of body experience. Can anyone else relate to that lol? Cleaning is the only thing I can do that takes my mind off it, but I have to start cleaning before the cravings start and then barely notice them when they start. | 2015-06-03T23:38:46+0000

What have been your biggest triggers to smoke lately? | 6 | That is another common one 10253. One strategy that sometime helps people if they are interested in reducing the cigarettes they smoke or quitting is to push that first cigarette just a bit later each day. What do you think might happen if you tried that (or have you)? | 2015-06-03T23:39:43+0000

I didnt really get cravings after I made up my mind not to. | 2015-06-03T23:39:45+0000

What have been your biggest triggers to smoke lately? | 10 | Experiments can be helpful because they can sometimes help us to realize we could get through a trigger without smoking when we didn't think we could. I urge everyone to try some type of experiment  this week if you can. I once challenged a guy who swore he could not quit for one day to do so and much to his surprise, we was able to do it quite successfully. | 2015-06-03T23:41:19+0000

What have been your biggest triggers to smoke lately? | 18 | Cravings are a doozy!  One thing to remember for all of you guys is that cravings only last about 2-5 minutes, and then they reduce so you just need some strategies to get you through those few minutes  when they are particularly tough. Strategies are to remind yourself why you don't want to smoke right now, picture your reason to quit, distract yourself, take a walk, chew gum, etc. I could do this all day but the key is for you to find some strategies that will work for you. | 2015-06-03T23:54:39+0000

10208 | Participant | TSP other post response comment |  | n/a |  | Hi Everyone, I'm here for the next hour to answer any questions or chat about smoking and quitting.

What have been your biggest triggers to smoke lately? | 6 | Distraction can be a very good thing when you are quitting. E-cigs are a mixed bag. Some arguments say that having them can be triggering because they mimic a cigarette, but great that it worked for you - especially if there was no nicotine. How are you feeling now about smoking, I take it that you are smoking again, which is why you are here. When do you think you might be ready to quit again? | 2015-06-03T23:08:33+0000

I hear a lot about cars being triggers and also motivators to quit because they are tight environments. When you quit, it will be important to clean your car, completely and totally. Did you try that last time? | 2015-06-03T23:18:23+0000

Use that when you are thinking about quitting this next time around and remind yourself of what it will feel/look/smell like to have your car like that again. Another strategy that might help you is adding up the $$ spent on smoking to see how much you will save if quit.
