Tell us your plan for resisting nicotine cravings during nighttime after your quit date. #control | 1 | Usually after my midnight snack is when I crave one, two, or even three cigs back to back. That's been extremely tough. I come so close to breaking every night. I usually FaceTime my boyfriend to keep me distracted or put on something to watch. | 2015-10-03T19:13:30+0000

How did the vape help you to quit? You know that since a lot of the long term consequences of vaping are still unknown I can't recommend them 100%, but I think it's great that you have quit smoking cigarettes - you can be proud of yourself! | 2015-09-29T22:12:25+0000

The vape helps because it's just a much easier transition than the gum or patch. It helps with the nicotine fix as well as things like throat hit and hand and oral fixation. It's easy to grab that when I'm having a craving and can actually feel satisfied. Now I'm gradually reducing the nicotine content of my liquid and how often I use it. It's much easier to ignore cravings when all I have is the vape, too. | 2015-09-29T22:31:01+0000

I also think it's a very good idea to taper down your nicotine content if your aim is to become completely nicotine free in the long run and it sounds like you are well on your way to doing just that. I would advise you to try to not use your vape in the same situations you used to smoke cigarettes to also get rid of the psychological addiction (e.g., the connection of smoking with a certain mood or situation). What do you think about that? | 2015-09-29T22:41:03+0000

Here’s a tip: instead of lighting a whole cigarette and stopping halfway, break half of it off first then finish it. How did it go? Do you think you could do this for all future cigs? #feelinghealthy | 1 | I tried this when I was cutting back. I first started by switching from 100's to shorts, then to half of a short. I didn't break them in half just cause they didn't light well, but I made a little indentation with my nail to tell me where to stop. It really helped me cut back more cause it was easier to smoke just a few puffs than abstain completely. I actually haven't had a real cigarette in over a week and barely touch my vape. | 2015-08-22T19:25:31+0000

Share your story here. #eyesontheprize | 1 | I've quoted this quote a thousand times, but I suppose that just means I haven't tried hard enough to quit. The e-cig is what I've seen the most change in myself with, but I firmly believe it to be a substitute and not a solution. | 2015-08-06T19:14:43+0000

Like currently in attempting to reach my quit date and my newborn nephew is in the hospital doing terribly and I'm two hours away on a work business trip. | 2015-08-06T19:20:46+0000

Share your story here. #eyesontheprize | 3 | I've tried to quit a couple times before. I've tried quitting cold turkey and lasted a few days to even a few weeks, but something always seems to happen and I lose my willpower and start back. I've tried gradual reduction and just never make it all the way to zero. I've been using my vaporizer and almost completely stopped smoking cigarettes and just have to hope that gradual reduction will be easier when I can control the nicotine in the liquid and still use it when I feel like I need it but just get a lower dose, rather that just trying not to light up at all. | 2015-08-06T19:49:20+0000

I've had to cut back on them/go without a few times because of lack of money, but now that I've been smoking for awhile it's been harder to do that and if not for Wellbutrin I probably wouldn't be able to quit at all. | 2015-08-07T00:41:16+0000

Vaping has helped me alot to. | 2015-08-07T04:56:32+0000

10406 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | Have you ever noticed a connection between smoking and your mood? Is there an emotional state that gets you to light up more frequently? #TDII | 1 | Ohhhh yes. I smoke much much more when I'm stressed or anxious. I'm also more likely to smoke when angry or depressed, but just a little bit less so than stressed. When I'm happy, I usually only smoke socially or when I'm driving. | 2015-08-06T00:20:55+0000

Have you ever tried alternatives to smoking to improve your mood in these situations? How did it go? | 2015-08-06T00:25:28+0000
10406 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | Have you ever noticed a connection between smoking and your mood? Is there an emotional state that gets you to light up more frequently? #TDII | 3 | I have, and some things help and some things don't. Typically, when things get too hectic I feel like I just don't have the willpower or mental energy to deal with whatever is going on /and/ fighting cravings. It's too easy to just say "screw it" and light up a cigarette without a second thought. I'm trying to be more concious about my mood when I get cravings now though. I've been trying to make myself wait at least 10-15 minutes before smoking when I know it's just because I'm upset. About half the time, the craving will pass. | 2015-08-06T00:35:49+0000

If you want to can also try to keep track of your mood, pleasant activities, and smoking in this log that we have developed. It may help you to get a better understanding of your triggers.

10406 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | Have you ever noticed a connection between smoking and your mood?

My husband and I want to start a family in 3-4 years and it is imperative that I've completely quit before then. I refuse to expose my hypothetical future kids to the risks associated with smoking while pregnant or second hand smoke. My main motivation short term is that the longer I keep smoking, the harder it will be to quit in the future. | 2015-08-06T01:02:19+0000

It helps with nicotine cravings, oral fixation, and (depending on voltage setting when I feel like it) even a little bit of that throat hit feeling. Right now I need a minimum 18mg liquid, but my goal is to 100% ween off of real cigarettes and then start gradually reducing the nicotine level of the liquid I use. | 2015-08-05T19:38:59+0000

I already had bad lungs to begin with and smoking definitely hasn't helped at all. My boyfriend, with whom I've celebrated one year with yesterday, has I think it's called COPD? He has something where the smoke bothers him a lot and he can't stand to be near me when I smoke or smell like it etc. Of course I would also like to save $1900 a year. | 2015-07-22T20:11:12+0000

Flavor was never really an influencing factor when it came to me smoking at first.

They seems safer to try since even though they have chemicals, the have /less/ chemicals. Plus, it's easy to think they're safer since (supposedly) the only ingredients other than nicotine (at least in vape juice) are food safe, and we don't yet have enough hard evidence to show a causal link to quite as many adverse effects of cigarettes caused by ingredients other than just the nicotine. | 2015-07-18T21:28:55+0000

(Experts agree this is the most effective way to quit for good). #TDII | 4 | Great 10411! This is already one of the most important steps to quit smoking. Other things you may want to consider: 2. Get support from family/friends/colleagues. 3. Learn new skills and alternative behaviors for your high risk situations. 4. Depending on how much you smoke, I would definitely recommend that you consider trying some form of nicotine replacement therapy – we know that using these can dramatically decrease your cravings and withdrawal and increase your chances to quit for good. 5. Be prepared for relapse or difficult situations (e.g., alcohol, being around other smokers, stress, etc.). I know this sounds like a lot, but we will cover each of these aspects more in depth over the next weeks. How does this sound? Anything there you think may be useful? | 2015-07-16T01:02:53+0000

(Experts agree this is the most effective way to quit for good). #TDII | 11 | Great question 10406! The problem with e-cigs or vapes is that there is no clear data up to now showing that they really help smokers quit. Also, they are not regulated by the FDA, which means that it is unclear what is in them. For all we know, they may still be harmful to your health. I would recommend using nicotine replacement therapy: gum, patch, inhaler (prescription), or lozenge (prescription). Also, other prescription medication like zyban or chantix can be effective, but you have to talk to your doctor first to get a prescription. I recommend trying one of these options before trying an e-cig. Check this for additional information http://smokefree.gov/e-cigarettes. | 2015-07-16T01:54:28+0000

I hate when people catch an attitude about me smoking. Honestly it'll make me want to light another. So I would ask them to chill with the attitude. If they would kindly talk about my smoking it'll be better. I've asked for their support but most don't care or they just contribute to my continued smoking. | 2015-08-07T00:39:03+0000
