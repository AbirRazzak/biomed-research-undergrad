1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | Do you think you will EVER be ready to quit smoking? Why? Why not? #TDII | 15 | That's ok - no worries! You are well prepared and have strong reasons for quitting and staying smoke free - so you shouldn't worry too much about relapsing. Also, it's up to you if a lapse will lead to a full blown relapse. Even if you lapse you should tell yourself that this happens to a lot of smokers trying to quit and that it doesn't mean you have to go back to the way things were. Throw away your cigs, lighter etc. and go back to quitting! Do you think this may help? | 2015-08-12T23:50:19+0000

I wonder if we can find things that would be more helpful for you in these difficult situations. Have you ever tried other medication (zyban or chantix)?

Too often i see the commercials and ads where there's someone in a wheelchair because of smoking. While its a little encouraging, its more of the same thing over and over again.

Does that change how you feel about smoking and quitting? #TDII | 8 | Great! I will do my best to help you prepare for the quit day - 2. Get support from family/friends/colleagues. 3. Learn new skills and alternative behaviors for your high risk situations. 4. Depending on how much you smoke, I would definitely recommend that you consider trying some form of nicotine replacement therapy – we know that using these can dramatically decrease your cravings and withdrawal and increase your chances to quit for good. 5. Be prepared for relapse or difficult situations (e.g., alcohol, being around other smokers, stress, etc.). I know this sounds like a lot, but we will cover each of these aspects more in depth over the next weeks. How does this sound? Anything there you think may be useful? | 2015-07-09T00:28:56+0000

Does that change how you feel about smoking and quitting? #TDII | 14 | Yes that sounds like a good idea. You could also ask them not to smoke around you and not to offer you cigarettes (if it's your friends that is). Most people will be happy to support someone in quitting. It may also initially be a good idea to cut back on the drinking or not drink at all for a while until you feel more confident that you can handle those situations. What do you think is the right way for you? | 2015-07-09T01:02:13+0000

What do they think about your smoking? #TDII | 24 | 10278 - I have some more suggestions and resources that you may find useful: Quick stress relief at home  Entertaining. Prevent pre-party jitters by playing lively music. Light candles. The flicker and scent will stimulate your senses. Wear clothes that make you feel relaxed and confident instead of stiff and uncomfortable. Kitchen. Cool the kitchen commotion by breathing in the scent of every ingredient you use—even if you’re just opening cans. Delight in the delicate texture of an eggshell. Appreciate the weight of an onion. Children and relationships. Prevent losing your cool during a spousal spat by breathing and squeezing the tips of your thumb and forefinger together. When your toddler has a tantrum, rub lotion into your hands then breathe in the scent.   Sleep. Too stressed to snooze? Try using a white noise machine for background sound or a humidifier with a diffuser for a light scent in the air.    Creating a sanctuary. If clutter is upsetting, spend 10 minutes each day to tidy and organize. Paint the walls with a fresh coat of your favorite calming color. Display photos and images that make you feel happy. Throw open the curtains and let in natural light whenever possible. | 2015-07-02T01:02:55+0000

Why do you think so many people are ready to adopt them even before proper research has been conducted? #ecig | 2 | I agree with 10278 that it is more public friendly than traditional cigarettes which cause a lot of people to start using them. Also, most are odorless which is more attractive to people causingthem to drop the old stinky version and go to something new | 2015-06-19T19:25:41+0000

I know a girl who's 16 and thought that these were safe. She had no idea there was nicotine in them | 2015-06-19T19:28:31+0000

Would you have started smoking at an earlier age if the product you used was flavored like your favorite candy? #ecig | 6 | I already started way to early so i dont think anything would have changed it | 2015-06-17T01:17:39+0000

The strength does matter though, and you should use the strength that makes sense depending on how many cigarettes you smoke each day. If you smoke more than 10 cigs per day start with the 21 or 15 mg patch (highest dose). If fewer than 10, you can start wiht the middle does (either 14 or 10). | 2015-06-11T03:51:11+0000

If not, what is getting in your way? | 7 | I like to leave you guys with tips in these session, so today, here is our 5-step TSP quit plan. See if something resonates with you: 1. GET READY.• Set a quit date and stick to it – not even a single puff! 2. GET SUPPORT AND ENCOURAGEMENT.• Tell your family, friends and coworkers you are quitting.• Talk to your doctor or other health care provider.• Get group, individual, or telephone counseling. Think about who can support you with quitting smoking3. LEARN NEW SKILLS AND BEHAVIORS.• When you first try to quit, change your routine.• Reduce stress.• Distract yourself from urges to smoke.• Plan something enjoyable to do every day.• Drink a lot of water and other fluids. Think about which of these will be most helpful to you?4. GET MEDICATION AND USE IT CORRECTLY.Talk with your health care provider about which medication will work best for you:• Medication: bupropion, verenicline (prescription).• Nicotine Replacement:-gum and patch are over-the-counter-inhaler and nasal spray are prescriptionIs there one of these that you think would be helpful for you?5. BE PREPARED FOR RELAPSE OR DIFFICULT SITUATIONS.• Avoid alcohol.• Be careful around other smokers.• Improve your mood in ways other than smoking.• Eat a healthy diet and stay active. | 2015-06-11T03:55:40+0000

They don't want to lose out on sales so they are trying to act like they care about smokers health by offering ecigs. They know quitting completely would be best for people but they wouldn't make any money that way. | 2015-05-31T19:03:28+0000

To have you remain a loyal customer? To help you quit smoking? Other ideas? #ecig | 5 | I don't think they want their customers to quit smoking. If that happened they would lose money. This way the customers can think they are doing better by using these type of e cigs while the tobacco companies still make money. | 2015-05-31T20:13:17+0000

To have you remain a loyal customer? To help you quit smoking? Other ideas? #ecig | 7 | Its about the money.  I think its mainly targeted at teenagers because they are easier to use, plus a minor won't have to search for someone to buy them cigs each time.  With an ecig it can be used multiple times where as a regular cigarette can only be used once. | 2015-05-31T21:20:47+0000

Because then you don't have to worry about finding someone to buy your cigarettes.  They would be a lot more convenient for a minor. | 2015-05-30T19:04:10+0000

If you were a minor, do you think an e-cig would be more appealing and “safer? to try than a traditional cigarette? #beingconscious | 3 | I think for a minor it would be better to just try, but it is scary how popular e-cigarettes already are without knowing any of the side effects or how much chemical you are breathing. | 2015-05-30T19:05:05+0000

If you were a minor, do you think an e-cig would be more appealing and “safer? to try than a traditional cigarette? #beingconscious | 4 | I think minors find them more "stylish" then a regular cigarette. They don't have the smell that is usually attached to a smoker and it's easier to hide then with regular cigarettes. Its VERY scary how popular they are. Many people don't realise that the liquid nicotine is HIGHLY toxic for children to ingest. | 2015-05-30T19:30:16+0000

His boss thought that it was something to smoke pot out of. My friend got yelled at and almost fired until he explained what it was. Now idk if minors are more attracted to e-cigs or not, but I can see the mix ups happening more often when people aren't educated about tobacco products. | 2015-05-30T19:43:17+0000

Then having nicotine replacement therapy like patch or lozenge or gum on hand is a good idea to use as soon as you reach your quit date. We can also talk about other good strategy to help you get ready. Do you already have a new quit date in mind? | 2015-05-27T23:15:20+0000

Then preparing for that date, we recommend that you: 1. tell anyone and everyone that you are quitting; 2. get your nicotine replacement therapy or other medication ready - you can talk to a doctor about what might work best for you or buy some at the store if it is over the counter. As you get closer to the date, you can: 3. get rid of everything that reminds you of smoking. Are those things that you did in the past or not so much? | 2015-05-27T23:21:00+0000

10278 | Participant | User generated post |  | n/a |  | Ive been smoking on and off for 4 years now. I have quit a couple times. First time was a short period and went right back to it as soon as i could (a week). Second time was longer because i was pregnant. ( didnt smoke once i found out). And the last time was for about a month. I always end up going back because its literally a habit in my everyday life. Wake up smoke, smoke a few hours later. Have lunch smoke. Smoke a few hours later. Its always worse when my fiance gets home because we ate both smokers so when he goes i want to ect. | 0 | n/a | 2015-05-20T21:45:49+0000

Here are some options that may be helpful: http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/quit-smoking/in-depth/nicotine-craving/art-20045454 Do any of these sound like good options for you? | 2015-07-02T00:14:27+0000
10270 | Participant | User generated post response comment |  | n/a |  | What is the best way to stop craving? | 2 | I have tried those but they don't seem to work for me very well. Especially with griving and drinking | 2015-07-02T00:19:09+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | User generated post response comment | 10270  | n/a |  | What is the best way to stop craving? | 3 | 10270 is there anything that has worked for you in the past? In my experience some of these things work for a lot of people: Keep your hands busy: Use a stress ball, play a game on your phone, play with a Rubik’s cube, start a fun arts and crafts project. Keep your mouth busy: Use gum, hard candy, mints, chew on toothpicks, prepare healthy snacks like veggie sticks, drink plenty of water.Any of these sound useful? | 2015-07-02T00:22:45+0000
