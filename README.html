    <h2>Node Colors</h2>
      <p>
        There are two different colors of nodes in the graph. The orange node indicates
        that the node is a central node, a blue node indicates that the node is not.
      </p>

    <h2>Hovering</h2>
      <p>
        When hovering over the graph using a cursor, multiple pop-ups can be seen.
        These pop-ups occur when hovering over a node or a link.
        When hovering over a node, the node's ID (provided from the Facebook API) will
        be shown. When hovering over a link, the link's value will be displayed. This value
        represents the number of likes/comments (depending on which type of graph is selected)
        between the two nodes.
      </p>

    <h2>Statistics</h2>
      <p>
        With regards to what the "Central Node Value" is measured with, it is measured
        according to degree, not distance.
      </p>

    <h2>Buttons</h2>
      <p>
        The reset button resets the page, in case something is not loading. Also very
        helpful when coding and updating the page.
        The clear button just clears the current graph that is displayed. Really has no
        use as selecting a new graph will automatically clear the old graph by default.
      </p>
