I figured it didn’t cost any more than my cigarettes would have, and I felt like it was a gift to myself for making a fresh, nonsmoking start."

10501 | Participant | TSP daily post response comment |  | #healthyliving | 30 | #30: The following post was made by a successful quitter: 'I focused every day on another way that I felt better. One day, I’d notice how much easier it was to breathe, and another day I would realize how I could walk up the stairs without getting winded. Reminding myself each day about what I was getting out of quitting made it seem worthwhile.' How do you think you'll notice your body getting healthier when you quit? #healthyliving | 2 | I always hack up a lung in the morning, I hope that goes away. | 2015-08-27T20:13:50+0000

Which strategy did you choose and how did it go? #TDII | 9 | Great 10456 - I've got to run, but I'll leave you with the 5 most important steps to stop smoking in my opinion: 1. I would recommend to pick a quit day and following through with it. 2. Get support from family/friends/colleagues. 3. Learn new skills and alternative behaviors for your high risk situations. 4. Depending on how much you smoke, I would definitely recommend that you consider trying some form of nicotine replacement therapy – we know that using these can dramatically decrease your cravings and withdrawal and increase your chances to quit for good. 5. Be prepared for relapse or difficult situations (e.g., alcohol, being around other smokers, stress, etc.). I know this sounds like a lot, but we will cover each of these aspects more in depth over the next weeks. How does this sound? Anything there you think may be useful? | 2015-07-30T01:08:31+0000
n/a | n/a | TDII response comment like | 10456  | #TDII |  | Have you ever tried to quit or reduce your smoking? Which strategy did you choose and how did it go? #TDII | 9 | Great 10456 - I've got to run, but I'll leave you with the 5 most important steps to stop smoking in my opinion: 1. I would recommend to pick a quit day and following through with it. 2. Get support from family/friends/colleagues. 3. Learn new skills and alternative behaviors for your high risk situations. 4. Depending on how much you smoke, I would definitely recommend that you consider trying some form of nicotine replacement therapy – we know that using these can dramatically decrease your cravings and withdrawal and increase your chances to quit for good. 5. Be prepared for relapse or difficult situations (e.g., alcohol, being around other smokers, stress, etc.). I know this sounds like a lot, but we will cover each of these aspects more in depth over the next weeks. How does this sound? Anything there you think may be useful? | n/a
