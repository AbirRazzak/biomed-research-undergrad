But switching to another, more socially-acceptable way of ingesting nicotine wonâ€™t help you conquer your addiction. What would you rather do, take the easy way and switch to e-cigs, staying addicted and making these e-cig companies more money, or quit once and for all to live free of any level of nicotine-addiction?

It works really good for me. Or, I don't smoke when I'm sick. Then I just keep not smoking, that works too. Lol | 2015-07-30T02:32:26+0000

100005594500096 | Tsp Study | TSP other post |  | n/a |  | Hello everyone!We will be starting our 90 days of posts this week so look out for our first post soon.Remember: this group has MONTHLY incentives. The description for this is in the group description, but just to explain it again, you will get $30 after each month in which you comment for 30 days straight!This means that you will only get the incentive money if you comment every single day of the 30 days, and there are 3 chances to get $30 because this part of the study is 90 days long.Thanks for participating, everyone Victoria from TSP | 0 | n/a | 2015-07-19T19:00:41+0000

100005594500096 | Tsp Study | TSP other post |  | n/a |  | This group is for 18-25 year olds who smoke that want to learn more information about tobacco, how it affects your body, and the different quitting options available. Once you get more information about smoking and connect with other young adults who are in the same boat, you can decide if you want to make a change. Getting educated is the first step to making the right decision for YOU.This group has been randomly selected to have Monthly Incentives; you can accumulate $30 at the end of every month in which you comment every day, for a gift card of up to $90 at the end of the session. | 0 | n/a | 2015-06-19T18:22:17+0000
