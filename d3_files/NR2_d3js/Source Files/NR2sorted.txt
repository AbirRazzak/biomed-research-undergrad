That's a reason a lot of smokers mention. I am curious: And what do you not like about smoking? | 2015-02-12T01:16:46+0000
10029 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What would you miss most if you quit smoking for good? #TDII | 3 | What I don't like about smoking. Is the fact I have to go outside. The  knowing fact that I'm shorting my life every time I light up. The fact I might die before I'm able to see my daughter get married, the smell, the taste, the prices. | 2015-02-12T01:20:19+0000
10029 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What would you miss most if you quit smoking for good? #TDII | 4 | But everytime I go to quit. All of my health problems catch up to me. My asthma acts up worse then usual, I get sick quicker. | 2015-02-12T01:21:02+0000

1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What would you miss most if you quit smoking for good? #TDII | 8 | In any case: It's actually quite normal that your body would initially react with some symptoms of sickness. Your lung for example is trying to get rid of all the tar and toxins. This is something that usually gets better after a couple of weeks. As for your asthma - quitting smoking is the single best thing you can do to improve your symptoms in the long run. Does knowing this change anything for you? | 2015-02-12T01:44:22+0000

People, in general, are willing to try them because it makes sense that they would be safe, as it is essentially just glycerol, nicotine, and water vapor, which they basically are(up to 450 times safer than cigarettes). While not a harmless product, I can't imagine people not willing to try them before research has been done on them. Nobody waits to read the research on their toilet paper brand before trying it. That's because it is rational to assume it is safe enough to use without serious harm. | 2015-01-08T17:59:30+0000

10048 | Participant | TSP other post response comment |  | #beingconscious |  | What was your reason for picking up that first cigarette?

1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment | 10048  | #TDII |  | Hi everyone and welcome to TSP! I am available for the next hour. Let me know if you have any questions! #TDII | 2 | Good question 10048! While the hazardous health consequences of smokeless tobacco are lower than smoking cigarettes, smokeless tobacco is not safe or healthy by any means. Tobacco contains carcinogens, there is always the issue of addiction (nicotine), and cardiovascular disease to name a few. More comprehensive information is on the website of the Mayo Clinic. http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/quit-smoking/in-depth/chewing-tobacco/art-20047428?pg=2 What do you think about these? More or less severe than you expected? | 2014-12-23T17:12:09+0000
10048 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | Hi everyone and welcome to TSP! I am available for the next hour. Let me know if you have any questions! #TDII | 3 | Well, it says about what I expected, though I am curious as to how frequently and how severe these health problems occur/are in comparison to smoking. While they aren't a safe alternative to cigarettes, are they safer than cigarettes? I'm interested in the statistics pertaining to deaths caused by the product. | 2014-12-23T17:18:26+0000

Let me know if you have any questions! #TDII | 4 | They are definitely safer, there is no denying that. The only good data I know are based on oral snus use in Sweden. There, smoking rates and deaths attributed to smoking are down compared to other countries. Here is some information for you, if you are interested (at least the abstract) http://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/12/4/349.abstract | 2014-12-23T17:22:55+0000

Check it out if you are interested and let me know if you have any questions. I am not 100% sure if nasal snuff would be exactly the same in terms of consequences, but I think at least pretty similar. http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/29/sweden-smokers-option-snus | 2014-12-23T17:28:31+0000

I had to go to a meeting the night before the completion of the award was due, and I was only able to get a majority of the things finished. So, I explained my predicament to the others, and while I was gone, they finished the rest of the requirements! I was took completely surprised, and the fact that they worked to help get the achievement rather than let me take the whole burden was very refreshing. | 2014-12-21T04:31:58+0000
