Here’s a tip: instead of lighting a whole cigarette and stopping halfway, break half of it off first then finish it. How did it go? Do you think you could do this for all future cigs? #feelinghealthy | 0 | n/a | 2015-08-05T19:00:20+0000

For example, taking a walk, calling a friend on the phone, meeting someone for coffee, or just taking a nice hot shower! Talking in this group can also be a safe space to talk about any stress you may be feeling. | 2015-08-05T18:05:46+0000

10382 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What is currently your biggest smoking trigger? #TDII | 3 | Definitely anxiety. It is my first go to when I feel an attack coming on. | 2015-07-23T00:50:04+0000
10377 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What is currently your biggest smoking trigger? #TDII | 4 | I smoke when I get stressed about school, which isn't a problem right now because it's summer. But a cigeratte is perfect for study breaks, it gets my mind off of school for a minute and let's my brain recharge. I also like to have a cigarette right when I wake up with my morning coffee. I like to smoke when I drive or am in the car with anyone else. And I just like to sit down and relax and have a cigarette, it's just something that I love. | 2015-07-23T00:52:48+0000

10382 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What is currently your biggest smoking trigger? #TDII | 12 | There was a short time where I was really established with a counselor and was staying active with my mental health that I was able to completely quit cold turkey. It was the very start of college. When I felt severe anxiety attacks, I would the student health center. They had a relaxation room that really helped. It only lasted a couple of months before the stress of school weighed in and I gave up. | 2015-07-23T02:05:15+0000

We encourage you to attend one of Dr. Johannes Thrul's The Doctor Is In (Wed) or smoking cessation sessions (Thurs) to get some personalized advice from an expert. He will be scheduling this week's session very soon. What do you think?-Shirley from TSP | 2015-07-20T20:25:57+0000

I don't know what to do. | 3 | Hi 10382 - quitting can be though, so hang in there! A few things about medication: Nicotine replacement therapy such as gum, patch, and lozenge are available over the counter at pharmacies. Nasal spray and inhaler are prescription only, as are other sorts of medication such as Bupropion (Zyban, Wellbutrin) or Varenicline (Chantix) - you will have to talk to your doctor to get those. In some states nicotine replacement like gum or patch are available for free from the smokers quit line - just google -- "name of your state" + smokers quit line -- to find out more! Hope this helps! My next office hours are Wednesdays and I'm holding an additional counseling session on Thursdays - we can talk more then. | 2015-07-20T22:30:44+0000

Have/would you ever try one? #ecig | 4 | I like smoking an e cig but it couldn't replace a real cigarette. I have never met anyone who actually smoked real cigs that preferred an e cig. Everyone I know that smokes cigs says the same thing, screw e cigs lol. The only people that I know who use e cigs regularly never smoked normal cigs in the first place | 2015-07-19T23:38:51+0000

Be prepared for relapse or difficult situations (e.g., alcohol, being around other smokers, stress, etc.).

When we "quit" he always makes me get him cigarettes which in turn makes me buy my own. Patches and the gum definitely did not work for me.

For now do you think you can get to an agreement with your husband that he won't make you buy him cigarettes, if this has been a major factors for your relapsing in the past? Also it may help if he stopped smoking around you - at least initially. What else can he do to support you even if he is not quitting as well? | 2015-07-02T00:36:33+0000
