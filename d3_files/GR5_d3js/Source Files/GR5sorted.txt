If not, what is getting in your way? | 10 | I like to leave you guys with tips in these session, so today, here is our 5-step TSP quit plan. See if something resonates with you: 1. GET READY.• Set a quit date and stick to it – not even a single puff! 2. GET SUPPORT AND ENCOURAGEMENT.• Tell your family, friends and coworkers you are quitting.• Talk to your doctor or other health care provider.• Get group, individual, or telephone counseling. Think about who can support you with quitting smoking 3. LEARN NEW SKILLS AND BEHAVIORS.• When you first try to quit, change your routine.• Reduce stress.• Distract yourself from urges to smoke.• Plan something enjoyable to do every day.• Drink a lot of water and other fluids. Think about which of these will be most helpful to you?4. GET MEDICATION AND USE IT CORRECTLY.Talk with your health care provider about which medication will work best for you:• Medication: bupropion, verenicline (prescription).• Nicotine Replacement:-gum and patch are over-the-counter-inhaler and nasal spray are prescriptio Is there one of these that you think would be helpful for you?5. BE PREPARED FOR RELAPSE OR DIFFICULT SITUATIONS.• Avoid alcohol.• Be careful around other smokers.• Improve your mood in ways other than smoking.• Eat a healthy diet and stay active. | 2015-06-11T03:58:22+0000

1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | Event |  | n/a |  | Hi everyone, next week I will be starting with our special sessions to give you even more support and extra tips to quit smoking! We have designed a total of 6 sessions and each one will last approximately 45 minutes. In these sessions, I will work with each of you to come up with your own specific quit plan. Attending these will really increase your chances of quitting (if you desire to do so). All of this is going to happen on the wall of this event and I look forward to seeing you there! Please let me know if you have any questions. | 0 | n/a | 2015-05-08T18:13:40+0000

This is what happens to many smokers - it can be hard to follow through with a quit date. Part of this intervention is to prepare you to set a quit date and follow through with it. Next week I will also start with a series of smoking cessation advice sessions where I will work with each one of you to come up with your customized quit plan. Is that something you would be interested in? | 2015-05-07T00:16:06+0000

(Experts agree this is the most effective way to quit for good) #TDII | 6 | Great to hear that 10175 & 10246! In a nutshell these are the things I would recommend (sounds like a lot right now, but we will work on all of these during the course of TSP): 1. Pick a quit day and following through with it. 2. Get support from family/friends/colleagues. 3. Learn new skills and alternative behaviors for your high risk situations. 4. Depending on how much you smoke I would definitely recommend that you consider trying some form of nicotine replacement therapy – we know that using these can dramatically decrease your cravings and withdrawal and increase your chances to quit for good. 5. Be prepared for relapse or difficult situations (e.g., alcohol, being around other smokers, stress, etc.). I know this sounds like a lot, but we will cover each of these aspects more in depth over the next weeks. How does this sound? Anything there you think may be useful? | 2015-05-07T00:23:19+0000

This group is about supporting each other, so you are certainly not going to get any negative comments from me. I think it is great that you have decided to try to quit - and that's the most important thing. With regard to Chantix: I am not an MD and I would recommend you talk to your family doctor or a medical professional you trust - there may be ways for you to use Chantix. Also we can talk more about nicotine replacement therapy. I would be curious to find out more about how you used it before and if a higher dose or a combination of patch and gum may be a good idea in your case. Again, I would recommend you talk to your doctor about that. What do you think? | 2015-05-07T00:34:33+0000

School will be harder because everyone in cosmetology school smokes and they constantly ask me if I want to go smoke with them but I will talk to them tomorrow.

When is your next doctors appointment where you can find out about your medication options? Also, I think it's a very good idea to talk to your colleagues - you can ask them to not offer you any more cigarettes and not to ask you to smoke with them or smoke while you are around. | 2015-05-07T00:54:23+0000

(Experts agree this is the most effective way to quit for good) #TDII | 16 | I have an appointment a week from today. I seem to smoke more when I am at school and when I am driving. It's habit for me to just light up a cigarette as soon as I get in the car. I think it's more that I have habits that I have to break than the actual craving being that bad. The dad said he would quit with me so I can call him when I am wanting to smoke. | 2015-05-07T00:58:08+0000

(Experts agree this is the most effective way to quit for good) #TDII | 17 | Ok why don't you talk to him and tell him about your quit plans and about the quit date? We have already talked about the folks at your school and I definitely recommend you talk to them as well so they can support you or at least not make it any more difficult. Let's talk about smoking in your car: What could you do instead? Any alternatives to smoking or something that would distract you? I recommend on the evening before you quit day get rid of your smokes, lighters, everything that reminds you of smoking. Get a new scent for your car or even clean it the day before you quit, that will make smoking less appealing. What else could you do? | 2015-05-07T01:01:41+0000

Get some new tunes you like so you can sing along :) and in case you don't have it a hands free device for your phone so you can call someone when it gets really bad.

The vape store that I go to actually makes their own liquids and you can get different levels of nicotine so you know exactly what is going into them. In my opinion it's definitely safer but teens still shouldn't be using them or allowed to purchase them (which they're not) because of the nicotine in them. | 2015-05-06T02:28:48+0000

10246 | Participant | TSP other post response comment |  | n/a |  |  | 1 | I'll admit, I have not been able to quit. I want to, I really do. But three years of smoking builds so much crave, addiction, and habit. Any advice for me? Preferably something that doesn't cost much money. I really want to quit :( | 2015-06-17T05:33:11+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TSP other post response comment | 10246  | n/a |  |  | 2 | Hi 10246 - thanks for your openness! It's great that you are so motivated to quit and I understand your frustration - quitting is definitely not easy! Let me tell you this: Many smokers have failed quit attempts, the secret is to get back up and try again. I'd be happy to work with you to find a strategy that works for you. Which strategies have you already tried? | 2015-06-18T01:11:40+0000

Try different ways to cope with your cravings and get better at not smoking in certain situations. You could for example increase the time interval between cigarettes, decide to not smoke certain cigarettes (e.g., a specific one after a meal, or the first one in the morning, etc.), or declare certain smokefree zones. All of this will be a great preparation for your quit date. What do you think? | 2015-05-12T00:55:34+0000

1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TSP other post response comment | 10246  | n/a |  |  | 12 | Very cool 10246! I was just asking because also ecigs are not without risk and may potentially still be harmful for your health (even though most likely way less harmful than regular cigs). We simply don't know enough about them yet, and they are not regulated by the FDA, so we also can't be entirely sure what's in them. I just want to give you my reasons why I can't recommend their use 100%. I'll  keep checking in with you over the next couple of weeks to see how your quitting is going. But for now: Great job and enjoy your weekend! | 2015-05-16T03:28:43+0000
