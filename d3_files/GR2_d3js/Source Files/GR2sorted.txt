When you are having a shitty day, you make up for it by having a smoke. On the other hand, if you're having a really good day, you make it even better by enjoying a smoke on top of it. In this sense, smoking is a way for you to create 'false' reward for yourself. By smoking, you are artificially stimulating the reward pathways in your brain, making you expect rewards where there should not be any. I think that's not a very positive way to wire your brain, so quitting smoking will help me unlearn this and also be a chance for me to improve my self-control. | 2015-02-12T01:47:42+0000

1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment | 10052  | #TDII |  | What would you miss most if you quit smoking for good? #TDII | 10 | That's a very good observation, 10052 - and great to hear that you are seeing this as a challenge that you can learn something from. The only thing I would like to add to what you just said is that after smoking for a while, the only thing smoking will do for you is really just helping you get rid of your withdrawal for a short time. So essentially you are in a state of withdrawal for most of the time and smoking will get you back to normal. So if you quit for good in the end you will be in your 'normal' state all of the time - isn't that nice to know?! | 2015-02-12T01:51:49+0000

10052 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What would you miss most if you quit smoking for good? #TDII | 11 | I definitely would like my 'normal' state to be my default mode - I'm working towards day 42 so I'm on my way to that. However, I do believe in rewards when they are truly earned - so I hope to one day be able to enjoy a cigarette on special occasions without it becoming a regular habit. But personally, I think that's a level up in difficulty from not smoking at all, so it's something I hope to work up to in the future. | 2015-02-12T01:58:22+0000

I think you are making the right call for now 10052 - better safe than sorry until you are really rid of your habit! An alternative future scenario may very likely be that you may find cigarettes losing their appeal and don't taste as nice as you remembered them. But in any case I just recommend to be careful so you don't end up taking it up again. | 2015-02-12T02:05:09+0000

10052 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What would you miss most if you quit smoking for good? #TDII | 14 | Yes, thanks for the advice Dr. Thrul! And yeah, you're totally right that cigs don't taste very good the first time you smoke them after a while - unfortunately, that hasn't deterred me from relapsing before. You're also right that trying 'controlled smoke' will increase my chance of relapsing, so I don't plan to try that any time soon as per your advice. However, having the level of self-control to 'controlled smoke' is what I strive for as my 'ideal self' in the far future. I know I am definitely not there yet and still have a long way to go. I really appreciate your advice and guidance today - they are helping me work towards developing this self-discipline! | 2015-02-12T02:17:02+0000

10052 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | Hi guys, what is currently your biggest smoking trigger? #TDII | 1 | I'd say after finishing something that took a lot of work or effort - I really like that 'phew, I'm finished, I'm gonna relax now' cigarette. | 2015-01-22T01:13:19+0000

10052 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | Hi guys, what is currently your biggest smoking trigger? #TDII | 3 | What's realistically always available is savoring the fact I worked hard and am done, or looking forward to something fun that might be happening later. | 2015-01-22T01:28:13+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment | 10052  | #TDII |  | Hi guys, what is currently your biggest smoking trigger? #TDII | 4 | That's great 10052 and I agree, just taking some time to really savor the feeling of accomplishment can already go a long way!

10052 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | Hi guys, what is currently your biggest smoking trigger? #TDII | 6 | If you don't mind answering, there are a couple things I want to ask you: 1) What advice do you have for staying motivated over the long term to be smoke-free? I successfully give it up for ~2 months for lent every year, but it's really a lot more difficult to stay smoke free for a longer, more permanent timescale. 2) What is your advice for coping with relapse? My experience is I kind of give up just start smoking whatever I feel like, which I think a lot of others could relate to. | 2015-01-22T01:34:26+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment | 10052  | #TDII |  | Hi guys, what is currently your biggest smoking trigger? #TDII | 7 | Those are great questions 10052! For long term success I think it is crucial to reward yourself and establish habits that go against smoking. For example a healthy lifestyle with healthy food and enough exercise. Also you should pay attention to your body becoming more healthy because you stopped inhaling all of those toxic chemicals. Also a great long term strategy can be to safe the money you previously spent on cigarettes and reward yourself with something really nice, for example a vacation or something you always wanted (I'm sure you can think of something). | 2015-01-22T01:43:55+0000

1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | Hi guys, what is currently your biggest smoking trigger? #TDII | 8 | As for your second question: Lapses can always happen and that's nothing to be afraid of. It's really up to you though if they become full blown relapses and that's something that is up to you to decide. What I always tell my patients is that when you have a lapse you should really see it as such. Right away get rid of the cigarettes and paraphernalia you may have bought and immediately continue with your quit attempt. | 2015-01-22T01:47:17+0000

10052 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | How do you feel about your quitting now? Still feeling committed to staying smoke free? #TDII | 1 | Yes - the first week was pretty bad (I haven't had withdrawal hit me like that before, even on previous attempts), but it has been significantly easier the second week! I would like to one day enjoy the occasional smoke on special occasions without it becoming a habit, but for now the goal is to stay completely smoke free | 2015-01-15T01:38:28+0000

Still feeling committed to staying smoke free? #TDII | 2 | Great job 10052 - keep up the good work! Yes withdrawal is a funny animal and can be very different during different quit attempts. Glad to hear it's getting easier though. What works for you to cope with craving and withdrawal? | 2015-01-15T01:42:21+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | How do you feel about your quitting now? Still feeling committed to staying smoke free? #TDII | 3 | by the way: I think your decision to stay completely smoke free is a good one, especially at first. The problem with 'controlled' smoking is that not very many people are able to do it - and we basically have no idea who is able to do it and who will relapse back to regular smoking. | 2015-01-15T01:49:09+0000
10052 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | How do you feel about your quitting now? Still feeling committed to staying smoke free? #TDII | 4 | Breathing exercises by default if I feel a craving - it's just so quick, easy and simple that I have no reason not to spend 30 seconds doing this. For the kind of craving that doesn't just go away, I also think about the long-term disappointment I'll have after caving in compared to the short-term pleasure I'd get from a smoke. I also acknowledge myself for doing a good job of getting this far.   Yup, I'm 100% with you on the controlled smoking (didn't realize there was a term for it) - it will take even more discipline to do than not smoking, period. I hope I'll work up to that point one day once I've stayed smoke free for a while. | 2015-01-15T02:07:47+0000

10054 | Participant | TSP other post response comment |  | #beingconscious |  | How do you feel about a medication that changes its dose of nicotine to match the intensity of your withdrawal symptoms? Would any of you consider using varenicline? #beingconscious | 1 | I like the physical smoking, this would feel pointless. I like spending a few minutes smoking when i feel stressed. I dont think popping a pill in would feel the same. smoking makes you breathe in and out. Breathing is a big part of Meditation. So in a way, i see smoking as my 'meditation'. | 2015-01-09T19:32:10+0000

Would any of you consider using varenicline? #beingconscious | 2 | I definitely agree with 10054 that nicotine substitutes (I guess aside from vaping) can't replace the actual act and feel of smoking. However, when you are trying to quit, you are probably most likely to cave in to smoke when you are the most stressed out. I think a nicotine replacement may not be as 'nice' as having an actual smoke, but can at least take some of the edge off of an especially bad craving so that not caving in becomes more manageable. | 2015-01-09T20:40:53+0000
