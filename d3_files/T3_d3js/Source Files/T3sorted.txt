Here are my thoughts on the issue of low nicotine cigarettes: I don’t have a comprehensive list of low nicotine cigarettes, so unfortunately you will have to do some research yourselves. Previous studies suggested that there is a risk of what we call “compensatory smoking? with lower nicotine cigarettes – essentially smokers inhaling deeper to taking more puffs in order to get the same amount of nicotine. This, of course, would defeat the purpose of switching to a lower nicotine brand. However, more recent research has shown that this compensatory smoking may not happen for cigarettes really low in nicotine (for more information see this example http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/281392.php). If you decide to switch to a lower nicotine cigarette I encourage you to monitor your smoking behavior really carefully, so you don’t end up smoking more cigarettes or inhale deeper for example. Another alternative would be to gradually reduce the number of cigarettes you smoke of your current brand. Some things you could try there: Pick certain cigarettes you want to eliminate (e.g. the first or last one each day, a cigarette after a meal), you could also think about declaring smoke free zones to get you to smoke less (e.g. stop smoking in your car). Yet another way would be to gradually increase the time interval between cigarettes. What you are willing to try is really up to you – I simply want to give you comprehensive information so you can make an informed decision. | 2015-04-02T01:04:14+0000

Even though I am making it a priority to quit, others are not. And idk that I think it's very fair.

It's legal to smoke in some bars, as its a personal choice for the owners to make. Some places I frequent are restaurants by day and lounges by night, so you can smoke after the kitchen closes. And other restaurants have courtyards that allow smoking. It depends on the day, I guess. A while back, I left a bar after I was just seated outside because the kitchen was still open so they didn't allow us to smoke. We're looking to pass a nonsmoking ban across all establishments come May 1st I believe. | 2015-03-18T20:59:28+0000

10083 | Participant | TSP daily post response comment |  | #reflection | 56 | #56: Take a look at Christine’s story and share your thoughts about how smoking has forever changed her life and the way she nourishes herself. #reflection | 2 | Did she quit smoking? I think she's very courageous to share her story with the world... I would probably hide behind closed doors if I were in her shoes. I'm also stunned by her optimism, she said "...but I'm okay with that" when talking about the reality of her having to be nourished through a feeding tube for the rest of her life... But I also think it's because she doesn't have a choice. Maybe that's why she's speaking out, because we still do. | 2015-03-20T19:35:30+0000

It's definitely pushing me to quit smoking, because I'd never want to be in their shoes. It is awesome that people like them speak out though, because things like missing teeth and needing a feeding tube just aren't things I think most people think about when they smoke. It's definitely a big push to stop. | 2015-03-20T20:35:44+0000

Some look to be more glamorous and posh than others, some look very hipster... Nonetheless, I guess it's every kid's dream to have all the luxuries these people have (including a beard, a fedora, and tattoos, lol). There were so many ads, literally pages of them! Some showing up in the coolest & hippest magazines that young adults and teens are subscribed to. | 2015-03-16T19:24:17+0000

How you feel about these ads being made public on television and billboards? #smokingaffectsall | 2 | Watching this ad, I don't really know how to feel. I guess I have to be honest and say it makes me feel indifferent... I can feel the hurt and pain that she's feeling but it just isn't enough. I think maybe because this particular ad isn't very relatable to me, I don't know anyone personally close to me who has passed from smoking/ lung cancer. What does strike me though is how old she looks, the lines and wrinkles on her face are sooo deep for being so young. I know that's because of smoking. This is just one example, but overall I feel good about these kinds of ads being of importance in today's media. It's important for young people who maybe don't know the affects of smoking to see and learn from them. | 2015-03-11T19:09:12+0000

And with attitudes toward smoking becoming more negative, especially with people my age, it does make me want to quit more. | 2015-03-11T20:04:25+0000

It's so hard when you're significant other doesn't want to quit. But we're both trying, we've limited ourselves to only one cigarette at night. And I hide the pack so I know we won't cheat. I still go without cigarettes on most days... But that doesn't change the fact that I smoke them sometimes.

That craving just wont go away! WHYYYY?! But other than that, when I'm drinking alcohol with friends and when I'm feeling down and out. I think i like to smoke when I drink because i feel that it sobers me, it makes me feel less drunk than i probably am and always gives me a reason to walk away from all the noise and craziness for just a moment. And i don't know why i like to smoke when I'm in the middle of stressful situations, its the feeling of smoking i suppose... makes me feel light headed and, ultimately, more calm than i previously was feeling.

Do we get a dollar per post for just simply posting something or do we get compensated on actually answering the question?

Do you think exercise can help you deal with cravings or help to reduce/quit smoking? #TDII | 3 | I do pushups, leg raises, pull ups, bridges, and squats, and even practicing balancing in a headstand or handstand is enough to distract me from smoking. Balance to me is just as important as strength so I like to stick with calisthenic exercise, and getting to ur blood flowing and endorphins pumping is a great distraction from cravings | 2015-03-05T01:16:27+0000

What will you tell yourself if this thought crosses your mind? #balance | 4 | I'm a runner so that's an easy one. Losing weight is definitely a drawback but quitting smoking helps my ability and agility immensely. I breathe better on longer runs and I feel healthier. So although, I don't want to gain weight... I would be able to start running longer distances. Cigarettes for me also work as a laxative so without them, I feel that I have to watch what I eat (since my metabolism isn't as fast as I'd like it to be)... I don't keep myself from eating what I want, but portion control and detoxing is something I've incorporated since I quit. | 2015-02-25T21:50:27+0000

Is there a connection between the two in your personal experience? #TDII | 2 | There absolutely is for me and my circle of friends. I find that smoking cigarettes helps to sober me, if that makes any kind of sense. When I feel I'm getting nauseous from binge drinking a cigarette typically calms me and eliminates those types of feelings. | 2015-02-25T21:46:38+0000

The hardest part about quitting for me, as I've mentioned before, is being around other smokers and in an environment where I'm drinking and partying!

So I never knew if my chronic headaches and increased irritability were caused by concussion or by withdrawal. The irritability lasted for about 7-9 days straight. So good luck with that part. I was also going through a rough time... Regardless of quitting. But I'm happy I took all the negative energy at once and now I'm feeling a billion times better! I also lost about 3 nights of sleep in a row maybe a week afterwards, but it's SOOO worth it. & that hard greenish, brown phlegm I coughed up was for only for the first two days after quitting too. So basically I just dealt with it, you will when you want something bad enough. | 2015-02-20T20:26:08+0000

Why might it be hard for you to quit? #beingconscious | 1 | I like to consider myself a social smoker so one of the cons I think of quitting would be being left out of the smoking social situations. Being at parties, etc. most people make a public announcement of them going to smoke and ask people to join them. I always described it as a "quiet time". You can escape loud music and go outside and actually talk to someone. Engage in a real conversation. I noticed the last time I quit, I was in college at a party, and I wasn't outside with the smokers crew. I missed having to go outside to be in nature (no matter what the weather conditions were like) just to smoke a joe. And I'd always have a partner with me, we'd talk about real stuff. Humph. | 2015-02-08T20:26:39+0000

Why might it be hard for you to quit? #beingconscious | 2 | Anyways, I got in a pretty bad wreck early yesterday morning. We're all extremely lucky to be alive. I didn't make it out unscathed but I'm still very blessed. So I decided to quit smoking. It's been about 34 hours and I've been outside twice with my boyfriend while he smoked. I have no desire whatsoever. So send over those saliva tests! I'm ready to initiate positive changes in my day-to-day life! | 2015-02-08T20:31:36+0000

Why might it be hard for you to quit? #beingconscious | 7 | 10083, we're so sorry to hear that, but glad that you are ok and have been smoke-free for 34 hours.Sounds like for most of you, the desire to smoke is triggered by social situations. It is definitely hard to resist smoking when others around you are doing it. So if you decide to quit, we highly encourage you to tell your friends so they can help minimize your urge to smoke. | 2015-02-09T19:04:06+0000

It also gives cool facts on how much money youve saved, how many cigarettes you've avoided smoking, the latest benefits and even how many mgs of chemicals you're without. I've also been without approx. 500 mgs of tar since my last one! | 2015-02-09T19:12:25+0000

Cigarillos have been flavored forever, I know nobody smokes those. But even when I roll a blunt, I prefer natural flavor. When I used an ecig, I didn't et crazy with all the flavors either. Kept it real light. I like the way cigarettes naturally taste. | 2015-02-12T20:04:51+0000

I always tell people it's not the nicotine I'm addicted to, rather the act of smoking. So I used an ecig (a lot less than I would use cigarettes) for two weeks straight and then stopped using that too.

Let me know if you have any questions! | 1 | I've got to run guys. One question that came up today was if there are any ways to get free nicotine replacement products to help with quitting. Many of the state quitlines actually provide nicotine replacement like the patch or gum for free. You can just google your state and "quitline" and see what comes up. See you next week and feel free to reach out if anything comes up in the meantime. | 2015-01-29T02:04:23+0000

If you were a minor, do you think an e-cig would be more appealing and “safer? to try than a traditional cigarette? #beingconscious http://buff.ly/1JvyHkU | 1 | I actually tried them before BECAUSE I thought they were safer since there wasn't any tobacco. I figured I was just getting nicotine. Also the flavors were super appealing to me and my friends in high school. | 2015-01-25T15:54:25+0000

Not to mention how cool these gadgets look and all the crazy flavor combinations you can get... Very appealing indeed. Most people I know that vape have never even tried a traditional cigarette so they use 0 mg of nicotine too. So yes, I would've thought it to be a safer alternative as well. | 2015-01-25T17:27:04+0000

Which will kill you a bit slower than real cigarettes but in the end you still die. | 2015-01-25T18:21:01+0000

10083 | Participant | User generated post |  | n/a |  | I met someone yesterday who smoked a pack of full flavor cigarettes every day for 22 years. She says after she quit she started to cough up tar... In place of what would normally be phlegm. Is this true and why is this? Also, another one of my friends quit cold turkey and got a severe cold. His doctor recommended that he slowly try to ween off them to prevent the withdrawal symptoms, I hope to quit cold turkey so what can I do to avoid this maybe? I do not smoke as often or for as long as he did either. | 0 | n/a | 2015-01-29T01:37:24+0000

First, it is pretty normal that the lung wants to get rid of all the toxins and tar after quitting, so some initial cough etc. is nothing out of the ordinary. This will get better after some time though (depending on how much the persons smoked). To answer you second question, withdrawal is a common concern of many smokers who are thinking about quitting. Nicotine replacement products can initially help to avoid withdrawal and slowly ween you off the nicotine - so this may be something to consider. How much do you currently smoke? | 2015-01-29T01:41:12+0000

I can pretty much smoke a pack in an entire night. But won't smoke the next day at all, makes me feel horrible (obviously). I don't think I have a problem with nicotine... I quit smoking cigarettes in the summer or '13 using a vape mod for less than 2 weeks with 0 mg of nicotine. I don't want to quit using any replacement products as I am actually against even taking medication to cure a simple headache. But I've been smoking year round since fall of '13. This is the longest period of constant smoking I've done & I haven't been exercising regularly since either. So these are new concerns I have for when I Hope to quit sometime this year. | 2015-01-29T02:31:58+0000

1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | User generated post response comment | 10067  | n/a |  | Does using rolling tobacco have any difference in health versus commercial cigarettes? | 1 | Hi 10067 - unfortunately I don't know of any studies that compared roll your own with pre-rolled cigarettes. I would not expect a difference with regards to health effects though, since essentially both options are combustion of tobacco which is the main factor for the adverse health effects. Does this answer your question? | 2015-02-12T01:13:08+0000
10067 | Participant | User generated post response comment |  | n/a |  | Does using rolling tobacco have any difference in health versus commercial cigarettes? | 2 | Yes thank you, wishful thinking | 2015-02-12T01:17:57+0000
10083 | Participant | User generated post response comment |  | n/a |  | Does using rolling tobacco have any difference in health versus commercial cigarettes? | 3 | I'm no doc but im gonna say rolling your own is worse. The filter (if the user even rolls one in) is way smaller than that of a normal cigarette. But I guess it may also depend on how you're rolling. I know people who roll teeny tiny, Virginia slim-like cigarettes and people who roll big fat ones. Less would be better? But that filter still gets me, idk. And they're so much cheaper. I think that's a bad thing too. | 2015-02-13T12:53:18+0000

10083 | Participant | User generated post |  | n/a |  | Ou, another question! So I hit my head really hard in the wreck and have had headaches on and off since then. Right now, I know for sure I'm experiencing a sinus headache. I've linked most of my headaches to my head injury... But my boyfriends mom says I probably have headaches cos I quit smoking too. Now, is there anything I can do to prevent those headaches? It's only been 4.5 days so I have no idea what kind of withdrawal symptoms are to come as well. | 0 | n/a | 2015-02-12T01:28:46+0000

One thing to do about that to consider would be to use nicotine replacement. But if you are feeling fine otherwise and can deal with your cravings that may not be necessary. Let me say one thing though: the good news about withdrawal symptoms is that they get better the longer you go without any smoking. So after about 2 weeks you can expect the physical withdrawal to be over. So just hang in there, use a painkiller if nothing else helps. Here are some more tips. Anything useful? | 2015-02-12T01:37:52+0000

10083 | Participant | User generated post |  | n/a |  | I know I've got 15 minutes till you're in, but I'm gonna go ahead and ask my question. I quit smoking 4 days and 15 hours ago. I recently started running again to train myself for the upcoming races in New Orleans. I've got a 10k come April. But I got in a wreck over the weekend and had what I would consider moderate TBI and I've had swelling and a lot of bruising to my knee and thighs. So running is out of the question for now... But what else can I do to prevent the weight gain to come? Idk how well dieting is gonna work for me either. | 0 | n/a | 2015-02-12T00:48:53+0000

And sorry to hear about your knee and I hope you get better soon! There are a couple of things I can recommend: First off you may consider taking it more slowly with your exercise like starting with quick walking first, before you run, to five your muscles and joints a couple of weeks to adjust. You may also want to consider other kinds of exercise that are less stressful on your joints - like swimming or cycling for example. With regards to food, there are plenty of options for healthy food choices. Here are some ideas. Do you think some of this is going to work for you? | 2015-02-12T01:10:51+0000

Not depriving myself of the food I love, but making it work in my favor by balancing it out with lighter portions for the rest of the day. I'll try walking till I can pick up running again. Thanks. | 2015-02-12T01:18:10+0000

And yes it's all about being flexible with regard to your food choices. You may also want to consider sugarfree gum, or healthy snacks like vegetable sticks throughout the day to help with the oral fixation and stimulation that cigarettes used to provide. Toothpicks to chew on can work great as well. | 2015-02-12T01:24:16+0000

This is not to suggest that people should just randomly start using them, since this study carefully administered them in the context of a treatment program. But, yeah they may be very effective to treat addictive behaviors. Here is a reference, if you are interested: http://hub.jhu.edu/2014/09/11/magic-mushrooms-smoking | 2015-03-05T01:12:03+0000
