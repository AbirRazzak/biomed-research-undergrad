How confident are you that you could quit smoking if you tried? #TDII | 6 | 10304, it's great that you are already able to go for a couple of days without having one - this really shows you that you can do it and your body doesn't really need the nicotine. It's also quite normal that there are some triggers that make it really hard to not smoke. What could you do in these situations, where you smell smoke, but don't want to smoke again? | 2015-06-25T00:22:54+0000

But I'm currently 7 months pregnant and am hoping to quit. My hormones have been off the charts and i have almost doubled my smoking habit. I was trying to slow down, but it just didn't work out that way. I have heard that completely stopping could harm my baby girl. Is that a myth? Is it safe or would i be better off just cutting down as much as possible? Thanks! | 2015-06-21T17:36:15+0000

Please check out these resources: http://women.smokefree.gov/9-myths-about-smoking-pregnancy.aspx I will hold the next TDII session on Wednesday and we can discuss more in detail what kind of quit plan may work for you. If you want to use stop smoking medication such as nicotine replacement therapy (this is an option during pregnancy and will help reduce your withdrawal) you should definitely talk to your doctor about it! | 2015-06-22T21:16:37+0000
