Meanwhile I feel the \"horror\" tactics and even the \"abuse\" symbolism (making a cigarette sound like an abusive boyfriend) are annoying and in some cases stupid, but different tactics reach out to and affect different people. However, I will voice I think it's wrong to use the ocassional graphic commercial, because the images can traumatize a child, yeah, it may teach them to stay away from tabacco, but the congratulations comes with being responsible for the irrational fears , nightmares, night terrors, potential hallucinations and other possible psychosis. So seeing something that is less of a miniature horror movie in the eyes of children (and honestly cringe worthy of some adults, like that teeth pulling one? Ew.) is a step in the right direction, but may lose the initial attention of viewers. I can tell you in elementary school they brought a glass truck holding a smashed car and a screen showing the \"story\" and face of the victim. Yeah, I can tell you I never drank and drive and I've prevented people from doing so, but there's no saying it was because of that shitty, non-kid friendly exposure. What I can tell you is I went to sleep as a kid seeing that face a lot and needing one of my parents to stay in my room. I am whole-heartedly for not traumatizing children to make a point that could have been made through other means.",

People who smoke are the same as people who don't smoke. If you're hiring someone to watch your kids that smokes, just make it clear that they aren't permitted to smoke around them, that would be acceptable, but to not hire them solely because they smoke is crazy. The only one of these I could understand is not wanting to date someone who smokes, the only reason I can understand is because if you are a non smoker and have a live in boy/girlfriend that smokes in the house, you are getting that secondhand smoke. But like I said, just tell them not to smoke around you or to smoke outside.",

If someone ruins their life over some sort of media, that's ultimately their own fault and not the company's. I don't like what companies do, but the reality is that everyone has a choice. Unless the companies are hiring operatives to sneak in our homes and inject us with nicotine to make us addicted, I have no quarrel. Even then, it's hard to keep children from endangering themselves (with tabacco or whatever else) but that's part of being a parent and should never be blamed on the system if it actually attempts to set up safe gaurds. Whether those obstacles work is usually the matter or someone not doing their job or willingly enabling a child. I'm just gonna stop myself there. I'm too opinionated.",

After he died, I swore to myself that I would never smoke and spent many years without coming in contact with anyone who did.

You're just getting addicted to something else, and like it was mentioned in a previous post, the BIG TOBACCO companies are making them! So that's a reason I'm not even going to invest into one because it's still profitting them. As far as the danger of it, not only are you still inhaling toxic chemicals, I had one that totally sparked in the part where you put the juice and almost blew up in my face while I was hitting it. So theres also the possibility of that happening! I think they're just as dangerous as cigarettes if not more, but they have a more pleasant smell to them so people think they are safer. I think people are just taking up a new dependence and addiction when switching to them.",

"message": "I'm probably the only one who feels that it actually alleviates my urge to have an actual cigarette and didn't have any bad side effects. Unfortunately I have to admit the only way it makes my urge to smoke go away is when the juices are high in nicotine, but even then, no nicotine acts as just as much of a replacement, but I need to use it more. I feel it may be less of a placebo effect for me than it is that I have an oral fixation. If I don't smoke, I want to eat, play with my tongue ring, chew on, or suck on something. I've actually done a bit of research on that myself, and it's believed to be linked to stress (agression and even being weaned too early lol) to have an oral fixation. But I acknowledge and can see I have a lot of stress. I smoke mainly when stressed and it used to be worth the immediate fix because I didn't care so much for my health. It's when it started affecting my loved ones health that I knew that it wasn't worth it. Overall, ecigs -feel- like the lesser evil, but I admit it could be no better, if not worse; I frankly contemplate on whether or not the battery system actually radiates our orifices and still can cause cancer.",

But since I smoked cigarettes regularly even when I was a minor, I don't think that I would've cared too much about statistics and warnings because I was smoking cigarettes anyways. Looking back now, however, I wish I would've listened to every smoker that told me not to start and did some research about not only the chemicals, but also the percentage of teens that start smoking at young age and end up quitting. I mean I know anyone can quit at anytime, although it's really hard, but I wonder if starting as a minor makes it harder to quit as you get older?",

Clearly she didnt understand that there was way more than just flavored water in it. So after about 15-20min of me explaining it to her she vowed never to use one again. So the point is minors do think its safer than a traditional cigarette because they dont fully understand what e-cigs are and do to your health",

To me, it's the same concept of trying to smoke let's say..vegetable oil. It's healthy for other purposes, but smoke is still smoke, and puffing on it doesn't sound smart. However, I may be the only one here who feels vapor is the lesser evil of smoking. To me, the known chemicals in them sound less harmful than the ones in actual cigarettes, and using vapor vs. Smoke, my symptoms with mucus and tight chest have lightened. I do however recognize, there is no saying the chemical reaction being far worse or that somehow vapor radiates our orifices or lungs. All around though, I have to say smoking in whatever form is bad, if not for the way it's consumed, then for the chemical reactions it has with our brain's chemistry. Nicotine is nicotine. Long rant like post, but I tried to cut it back, I'm passionate on this subject.",

Remember to turn on your notifications and check this page daily!2) Your group has been randomly assigned to a Monthly Incentive. To earn money, you must comment on ALL posts we share each month (30 days). You will earn $30 if you've commented on all 30 posts, and $0 if you've commented on 29 or less. We'll tally your comments every 30 days, and you'll have a new chance to earn money at the start of the next month. You will receive a gift card for the money you've earned at the end of the 90-day program.3) Dr. Johannes Thrul will be joining us for 1 hour each week, during which he will answer any tobacco-related questions, share info and resources, and provide support to our group. Stay tuned for his first session next week!",

Use the “Chew and Park” method: Chew the gum slowly until you can taste the nicotine or feel a tingling sensation in your mouth. Stop chewing and park the piece of gum between your cheek and gums. After about a minute, when the tingling is almost gone, start chewing again. Repeat this process until the tingle is gone (about 30 minutes).",
