What do you think of these laws? #smokingaffectsall | 2 | I agree with the idea that people who don't smoke shouldn't be subjected to a smokers second hand smoke. That being said, the removal or absence of designated smoking areas leads to littering and law breaking. I think they should set aside specific designated spots for smokers with appropriate disposal receptacles. | 2015-09-28T21:53:35+0000

Share your two different perspectives. #smokingaffectsall | 4 | As a smoker i get mad they cost so much. It just gives me even more incentive to quit. | 2015-09-24T23:08:38+0000

I would explain what my job is, what I do but I would also explain that the products my company makes are for adults and that they do have risks.

10356 | Participant | TSP daily post response comment |  | #beingconscious | 57 | #57: Statistics show that the most successful smokers use a combination of Nicotine Replacement Therapy (like the patch or gum) with some type of counseling to quit, but young adults are the least likely to use NRT’s to quit. Would you ever consider using an NRT? What about counseling to help you quit? #beingconscious | 6 | ive never even heard of that one before actually; maybe there's a lack of knowledge on some methods of quitting smoking | 2015-08-26T20:46:08+0000

But again as horrible as it must make me seem...I must say we all know the risks when we start using tobacco products.

Is it legal to smoke in restaurants or bars in your state? How does it affect you? #smokingaffectsall | 2 | I'll Start out by saying I'm in the state of Arkansas. They do not allow smoking in restaurants here anymore, but I've never been to a bar that didn't allow it. I think it's a good thing to limit it in public places. Even being a smoker myself, I still agree that other people who don't smoke shouldn't be subjected to suffering just because a smoker wants to light up wherever they want. And who the hell wants to smoke around people who are eating/serving food? I don't smoke when I eat or prepare my food. That's unsanitary. | 2015-08-23T19:35:12+0000

When you're in a bad place in your life and cigarettes are a remedy and coping mechanism, that reality isn't scary and can be welcomed. But things eventually get better and when the addiction kicks in its frightening. | 2015-08-18T02:58:29+0000

How you feel about these ads being made public on television and billboards? #smokingaffectsall | 1 | I understand that they are trying to educate people about the bad effects of smoking but I feel like those of us who smoke, we know it's bad for us. We know this can happen or that can happen and I feel like I don't need it consistently shoved at me that smoking is bad. I know!! I make a choice to smoke, knowing the side affects. Stop reminding me. I get it. | 2015-08-12T19:08:57+0000

Like the ones with the lady that has the hole in her throat and talks with that machine or the one with the lady who has to wear a colonoscopy bag or whatever its called. I look at those commercials and get scared that ima end up just like them or worse. I hate those commercials but I guess there good in a way, they somewhat motivate me to quit. | 2015-08-12T20:08:38+0000

If we stop showing people cigarettes are bad, that in itself could increase smoking. Availability=good. Smoking while pregnant=bad. | 2015-08-12T21:00:12+0000

How you feel about these ads being made public on television and billboards? #smokingaffectsall | 6 | I think that while personal experience stories are not only more sincere and effective, I think  people are less likely to pay attention and grasp the effect. Meanwhile I feel the "horror" tactics and even the "abuse" symbolism (making a cigarette sound like an abusive boyfriend) are annoying and in some cases stupid, but different tactics reach out to and affect different people. However, I will voice I think it's wrong to use the ocassional graphic commercial, because the images can traumatize a child, yeah, it may teach them to stay away from tabacco, but the congratulations comes with being responsible for the irrational fears , nightmares, night terrors, potential hallucinations and other possible psychosis. So seeing something that is less of a miniature horror movie in the eyes of children (and honestly cringe worthy of some adults, like that teeth pulling one? Ew.) is a step in the right direction, but may lose the initial attention of viewers. I can tell you in elementary school they brought a glass truck holding a smashed car and a screen showing the "story" and face of the victim. Yeah, I can tell you I never drank and drive and I've prevented people from doing so, but there's no saying it was because of that shitty, non-kid friendly exposure. What I can tell you is I went to sleep as a kid seeing that face a lot and needing one of my parents to stay in my room. I am whole-heartedly for not traumatizing children to make a point that could have been made through other means. | 2015-08-12T23:21:29+0000

Doesn't make sense to have a designated smoking area even for employees of the whole property is smoke free. Sends a mixed message otherwise. | 2015-08-06T19:03:16+0000

Do you think it's better for society as a whole to have smoke-free workplaces? #smokingaffectsall | 4 | I think it's for the best. I've traveled a lot; in Salt Lake City's Airport in Utah they have smoking rooms that have suction to keep the smoke and air in, but circulated..I thought that was the coolest thing and a brilliant designated smoking area. In theory that's the only good kind of smoking area, as far as not exposing others and the environment, but it's expensive and smoke particles will still stick to clothes and other porous surfaces like hair. So all around, it's best to have a completely smoke free area available to the public. | 2015-08-06T20:11:50+0000

Since then I've seen a lot less hospital workers who smell like cigarettes in their work environment.

Friends, family, coworkers? #smokingaffectsall | 3 | I think about my family and my girlfriend - the people who want me to quit the most and the people who were most exposed to second hand smoke by me. Regardless of smoking outside, particles stick to clothing and hair (etc) and linger. This post brings up a lot of fear and the reason I want to quit. | 2015-08-04T19:35:58+0000
10356 | Participant | TSP daily post response comment |  | #smokingaffectsall | 35 | #35: When you read this statistic, who in your life do you start thinking about? Friends, family, coworkers? #smokingaffectsall | 4 | Honestly I don't think too much of anyone when I read this. Maybe I'm selfish, or maybe because I smoke near other smokers or away from all the non smokers. Really the only thing that concerns me in relation to second hand is that I might accidentally drop a hot ash while smoking and starting a fire. | 2015-08-04T19:40:33+0000

Unbiased therapy, phone support, and they offer coupons and some stop smoking aids for free! Pretty good resource! For example my state has the Arkansas quit line. | 2015-07-27T19:46:56+0000

Try it out today and tell us how it went. Were you able to put off lighting up for a little while? #feelinghealthy | 4 | I was able to put it off for a while. I woke up at 8am today and distracted myself until almost noon, which I know isn't too long, but for it being my first cigarette of the day it felt like it was a pretty long time. I even took a trip in the car without smoking one which was HUGE to me. It's one of my biggest triggers. I did cave though when I felt myself getting really  angry and upset, to the point I found myself screaming into a pillow!! (I had a somewhat stressful morning, so that didn't help) but as soon as I hit it a few times I felt myself calm down a little, but I also felt my chest tighten and I felt my breathing being affected. Sorry for this post being a bit long, but I felt like today I came to some realizations! | 2015-07-25T19:31:01+0000

I'm not going to lie though, I could really use a cigarette, I lost one of the kittens I've taken in to panleukopenia, the other came up positive for it too, and it's been horrific to watch what happens to such a fragile baby even when you try to nurse it. I don't think breathing methods is going to help me cope short term. | 2015-07-25T19:31:12+0000

Like other people have said they're a lot cheaper too, and you can sometimes smoke inside, so I think that draws people to them as well. | 2015-07-25T19:25:23+0000

How does it feel to see our society moving towards a tobacco-free mindset? #smokingaffectsall | 5 | I'm a little conflicted about this topic. On the one hand it would be nice to see fewer butts everywhere and less people dying from lung cancer. On the other, smoking doesn't do nearly as much damage to the communities in which people who smoke live as use of other more serious drugs might. I think the push toward quitting smoking should be every individuals own decision not one forced upon them by their society. | 2015-08-01T22:27:03+0000

This post is rather agitating though, I already feel that non-smokers are some of the most uptight and rude people for being so judgemental. | 2015-07-28T19:09:37+0000

I have never in my life judged someone because they smoke, to me the thought that people actually do is literally absurd lol. People who smoke are the same as people who don't smoke. If you're hiring someone to watch your kids that smokes, just make it clear that they aren't permitted to smoke around them, that would be acceptable, but to not hire them solely because they smoke is crazy. The only one of these I could understand is not wanting to date someone who smokes, the only reason I can understand is because if you are a non smoker and have a live in boy/girlfriend that smokes in the house, you are getting that secondhand smoke. But like I said, just tell them not to smoke around you or to smoke outside. | 2015-07-28T19:12:19+0000

I feel like they could have at least waited till they were not on shift anymore. | 2015-07-29T00:36:44+0000

I use a 5-7-8 breathing technique taught to me by nurses on one of my hospital admissions. It really helps if you're stressed or can't fall asleep. Inhale through your nose for five seconds, hold for seven seconds, exhale through your mouth for eight seconds. Really helps, especially if you can't relax. I was told it makes your brain release calming hormones. | 2015-07-23T22:25:02+0000

It says you can also say a word when breathing in and after you master the technique you will get to a point where all you have to do is say the word and you will feel that calmness. I am going to start trying this technique, especially when I get a craving. | 2015-07-24T18:01:43+0000

10365 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What is currently your biggest smoking trigger? #TDII | 1 | Anytime I'm mad, sad, stressed or anxious. So I would venture to say when I'm upset is my biggest trigger | 2015-07-23T00:38:16+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment | 10365  | #TDII |  | What is currently your biggest smoking trigger? #TDII | 2 | Thanks for sharing 10365 - yes these are definitely major triggers for many people. Have you ever tried to use alternatives to smoking to cope with upsetting situations? If so how did it go? | 2015-07-23T00:43:43+0000
10345 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What is currently your biggest smoking trigger? #TDII | 3 | After I eat and when I'm in the car are my two biggest triggers. | 2015-07-23T00:44:42+0000

What else could you do after a meal or in the car other than smoking? Have you every tried anything? | 2015-07-23T00:47:36+0000
10365 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What is currently your biggest smoking trigger? #TDII | 5 | I was in therapy for 2 years so I've tried using some of my coping methods that I learned but it just didn't work out. We're definitely creatures of habit, I've been smoking for almost 8 years now and it's so hard to break that routine of oh I'm upset so I need a cigarette. That's been my go to coping method for so long. | 2015-07-23T00:48:36+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment | 10365  | #TDII |  | What is currently your biggest smoking trigger? #TDII | 6 | I hear you 10365, habits can be really hard to overcome and change. In those past 8 years of smoking have you ever had periods when you smoked less or even didn't smoke at all? | 2015-07-23T00:51:01+0000
10356 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What is currently your biggest smoking trigger? #TDII | 7 | Stressful situations or punk shoes | 2015-07-23T00:55:38+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment | 10356  | #TDII |  | What is currently your biggest smoking trigger? #TDII | 8 | Hi 10356, stress can be a big trigger as well. What is it about punk shows that triggers smoking for you? | 2015-07-23T00:59:22+0000
10365 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What is currently your biggest smoking trigger? #TDII | 9 | I was hospitalized twice and I wasn't allowed to smoke either time but smoking was all I thought about because I was a mad teenager who couldn't have her smokes. There was also a period when I first moved out of my parents where I didn't work for quite awhile so I couldn't really afford to smoke so I did smoke less during that period. | 2015-07-23T01:15:14+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment | 10365  | #TDII |  | What is currently your biggest smoking trigger? #TDII | 10 | That's very interesting 10365 - so for you these were more or less situations of forces smoking abstinence or reduction. How did you cope with your urges to smoke back then? What worked and what didn't work so well? | 2015-07-23T01:19:18+0000
10365 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What is currently your biggest smoking trigger? #TDII | 11 | In the hospital I was going through withdrawal and was having a really bad time so the nurses gave me nicotine gum which only made my cravings worse. I didn't really cope, I would only get angry and during the time that I wasn't working I was pretty much always looking for change to buy a pack or bumming off of someone. I haven't found anything that actually makes me not want a cigarette, even when I'm sick I still want to smoke. It's a big crutch in my life and I think that's why I have such a hard time. I have a daily routine for my smoking times. When I wake up, when I eat, when I'm driving I smoke way too much, when I'm bored, breaks at work, and I have to have one before bed. | 2015-07-23T01:24:37+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment | 10365  | #TDII |  | What is currently your biggest smoking trigger? #TDII | 12 | It sounds like the nicotine addiction and habit is really strong in your case 10365. Have you ever thought about using other forms of nicotine replacement or other medication at all? | 2015-07-23T01:26:52+0000
10365 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What is currently your biggest smoking trigger? #TDII | 13 | I refuse any type of medication to help. I'd prefer a natural method but haven't come across any. Nicotine gum definitely does not help. I've considered trying patches but I'm on the fence about spending money on them if they aren't actually going to help. | 2015-07-23T01:28:32+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment | 10365  | #TDII |  | What is currently your biggest smoking trigger? #TDII | 14 | That's absolutely understandable 10365 - I wouldn't want to spend money on things that don't work either. From a scientific perspective I can tell you that nicotine replacement and other medication can definitely help a lot. But what you are willing to try is of course your choice. Here is a great overview if you want to know about your options: http://smokefree.gov/explore-medications | 2015-07-23T01:34:33+0000
10365 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What is currently your biggest smoking trigger? #TDII | 15 | I think out of all the options I would try patches first. I think we should have a post dedicated to what methods we have tried using so we can hear everyones thoughts and opinions on certain products and get some recommendations! | 2015-07-23T01:39:21+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment | 10365  | #TDII |  | What is currently your biggest smoking trigger? #TDII | 16 | That's a great suggestion 10365 - I will do that next week! | 2015-07-23T01:41:05+0000

How does it feel to be targeted by a huge, expensive marketing campaign? #beingconscious | 1 | I don't really see a difference in how the tobacco companies target us vs how other companies target people. Tobacco companies aren't the only ones who use big expensive marketing to get us to but their products, fast food companies do it, clothing retailers do it ect. It's all about money. So I can't say I feel one way or the other. | 2015-07-22T19:04:58+0000

And obviously they succeed, as any of us smokers can attest. I still don't blame a tobacco company for me taking up smoking though. I was a legal adult and made the choice to try them myself. No advertising convinced me unless it was so subliminal I didn't even notice it. | 2015-07-22T19:06:00+0000

Their advertising is really lame anyways. Tobacco commercials never made me think like, "Wow those people look so cool!" lol the only advertising that affects me in any way, is when the cigarettes have coupons on them to save money on the pack. | 2015-07-22T19:11:35+0000

I don't like it, but at the same time, I don't find myself to be easily persuaded- I'm stubborn and a free thinker. If someone ruins their life over some sort of media, that's ultimately their own fault and not the company's. I don't like what companies do, but the reality is that everyone has a choice. Unless the companies are hiring operatives to sneak in our homes and inject us with nicotine to make us addicted, I have no quarrel. Even then, it's hard to keep children from endangering themselves (with tabacco or whatever else) but that's part of being a parent and should never be blamed on the system if it actually attempts to set up safe gaurds. Whether those obstacles work is usually the matter or someone not doing their job or willingly enabling a child. I'm just gonna stop myself there. I'm too opinionated. | 2015-07-22T19:16:04+0000

I waited until I was 18 and away at college to take up smoking. Being away from my family and being a legal adult prompted me to try it. Not the way it was advertised or flavored. | 2015-07-21T19:02:12+0000

I don't feel I would, but I started smoking at a very young age, so perhaps it'd be possible I'd be dissuaded more soon by yummy flavors. But if there were flavored cigarettes now available, I honestly wouldn't want any. I don't smoke for the flavor. | 2015-07-21T19:03:13+0000

Would you have started smoking at an earlier age if the product you used was flavored like your favorite candy? #ecig | 6 | I would have to say no because up until I started smoking, I hated it. As a kid I hated the smell and hated when people would smoke around me. I remember once when I was little, I crushed up and threw my mom's cigarettes away. (She was really mad lol) but no I don't think that a flavoring would've made me start sooner. I might've tried it, but I don't think that I would've taken it up. But I also agree with 10351, I first tried and slowly began smoking when I was 13-14, so I was already really young. | 2015-07-21T19:58:21+0000

They're just going to try and ram the health aspect of quitting and the risks down your throat. So that's why in a sense I say no. Now it would be different if it was a doctor that you have been going to and they know you on a somewhat personal level and are looking out for your best interest, not just because there's a law requiring them to do so. In that sense I would say yes. I also think it depends in the manner that they approach telling you this. | 2015-07-20T19:13:31+0000

I'll have to figure out some better coping techniques once I for real quit. | 2015-07-17T19:05:00+0000

Why might it be hard for you to quit? #beingconscious | 3 | I'm afraid to quit because I was diagnosed with bipolar a few years ago and I have been doing really good and I haven't taken medication for the last year and a half and I'm nervous that if I quit I'll have trouble with my mood swings again. That is the only thing really making me not want to quit. | 2015-07-17T19:16:32+0000

Why might it be hard for you to quit? #beingconscious | 8 | I'm actually comforted to know I'm not the only one who uses smoking to cope with anxiety and anger. In the long run, this is my only real hurdle. There's always gum for oral fixation, but I can't think of a healthy alternative that actually works for soothing such extreme undesirable emotions. The fix works within a matter of minutes, if not instantly, so it'll be a hard crutch to give up. | 2015-07-17T23:49:38+0000

Within the exhibit there was a glass enclosure that acted as on of the walls filled with millions of cigarette butts. Less smoking would mean less cigarette butts. That's one of many ways that wold less people smoking would ensure environmental improvements. | 2015-07-16T23:25:57+0000

Post and share your experiences. #reflection | 8 | My Grandpa on my mom's side of the family died from lung cancer. I try not to think about it because I know he would be extremely disappointed in me for smoking. But it is also one of the reasons I started smoking. I remember the smell of his cigarettes. I only got to see him a few times a year. He would take me fishing and smoke while we fished. As much as I hate fishing, the time I got to spend with him holds a very dear and happy spot in my heart. After he died, I swore to myself that I would never smoke and spent many years without coming in contact with anyone who did. When I went off to college, one of my friends smoked and one day I smelled that familiar smell on them after a cigarette break and couldn't help myself. Smoking brings back memories of the time I spent with my grandpa but it also brings guilt because I know it would make him upset. | 2015-07-14T00:23:19+0000

It really makes me want to quit but most of the time I have the "it won't happen to me" thought and I know that in itself is dangerous | 2015-07-15T20:00:01+0000

And it's still delivering toxic chemicals into your system, just makes you feel better about it. The smell is less offensive though. My family definitely noticed the difference. | 2015-07-11T19:20:19+0000

Have/would you ever try one? #ecig | 9 | I've tried them and I feel like it's just something to replace smoking a cigarette. It's not kicking the addiction or the habit. You're just getting addicted to something else, and like it was mentioned in a previous post, the BIG TOBACCO companies are making them! So that's a reason I'm not even going to invest into one because it's still profitting them. As far as the danger of it, not only are you still inhaling toxic chemicals, I had one that totally sparked in the part where you put the juice and almost blew up in my face while I was hitting it. So theres also the possibility of that happening! I think they're just as dangerous as cigarettes if not more, but they have a more pleasant smell to them so people think they are safer. I think people are just taking up a new dependence and addiction when switching to them. | 2015-07-11T22:07:51+0000

Have/would you ever try one? #ecig | 10 | I'm probably the only one who feels that it actually alleviates my urge to have an actual cigarette and didn't have any bad side effects. Unfortunately I have to admit the only way it makes my urge to smoke go away is when the juices are high in nicotine, but even then, no nicotine acts as just as much of a replacement, but I need to use it more. I feel it may be less of a placebo effect for me than it is that I have an oral fixation. If I don't smoke, I want to eat, play with my tongue ring, chew on, or suck on something. I've actually done a bit of research on that myself, and it's believed to be linked to stress (agression and even being weaned too early lol) to have an oral fixation. But I acknowledge and can see I have a lot of stress. I smoke mainly when stressed and it used to be worth the immediate fix because I didn't care so much for my health. It's when it started affecting my loved ones health that I knew that it wasn't worth it. Overall, ecigs -feel- like the lesser evil, but I admit it could be no better, if not worse; I frankly contemplate on whether or not the battery system actually radiates our orifices and still can cause cancer. | 2015-07-12T01:22:48+0000

For me, I never know how many puffs of those things is equal to a cigarette so it's never really been helpful to me to erase the urge of smoking a real cigarette. | 2015-07-12T02:24:44+0000

There's definitely cravings for the nicotine, I would get super angry at everything and I also had mood swings. I was in the hospital and I wasn't allowed to smoke which drove me up a wall seeing as how I was already mad that I was there in the first place, I finally caved and agreed to try the gum that's supposed to help you quit and for me it only made the cravings worse. It seems that the symptoms are slightly similar to withdrawal from a drug. | 2015-07-09T20:01:30+0000

So I've been really busy, but I think eating slowly helps maintain your weight and lose weight in every scenario, not just quitting smoking because I have the habit of waiting too long to sit down and eat so when I finally do eat, I eat quickly and more than I would've even needed to feel full because I didnt give it a chance to digest! | 2015-07-10T22:26:16+0000

If anything, I feel that it would be a tactic to stay in the game and to remain dominant in sales. There's no saying vapor products wouldn't have addictive additives to them to make them seemingly more desirable. But maybe that's my conspiracy loving side- you never know, people do absurd things for money. | 2015-07-05T19:04:01+0000

But not thinking in a way like an evil mastermind rubbing their hand together. It's what all corporations do. When organic food became more popular, bigger food industries began making items like that as well. It's pretty much they are hopping on the band wagon. | 2015-07-05T19:16:15+0000

If you were a minor, do you think an e-cig would be more appealing and “safer? to try than a traditional cigarette? #beingconscious | 2 | I completely agree 10351!! But since I smoked cigarettes regularly even when I was a minor, I don't think that I would've cared too much about statistics and warnings because I was smoking cigarettes anyways. Looking back now, however, I wish I would've listened to every smoker that told me not to start and did some research about not only the chemicals, but also the percentage of teens that start smoking at young age and end up quitting. I mean I know anyone can quit at anytime, although it's really hard, but I wonder if starting as a minor makes it harder to quit as you get older? | 2015-07-04T19:17:25+0000

If you were a minor, do you think an e-cig would be more appealing and “safer? to try than a traditional cigarette? #beingconscious | 3 | Im glade they brought this up because im going through something similer where a relative of mine who is a minor was caught in a picture using one thats kind of like a hookah and when we confronted her she said that she wasnt smoking that all that was in it was flavored water. Clearly she didnt understand that there was way more than just flavored water in it. So after about 15-20min of me explaining it to her she vowed never to use one again. So the point is minors do think its safer than a traditional cigarette because they dont fully understand what e-cigs are and do to your health | 2015-07-04T19:21:13+0000

I've had e-cigs before and the fact that the nicotine intake wasn't measured in anyway, made it much more dangerous. The first one I had I smoked the entire contents of it in one day. Where as if I had had a pack of normal cigarettes I would have felt guilty about smoking so many cigarettes in one day. | 2015-07-04T20:16:18+0000

If you were a minor, do you think an e-cig would be more appealing and “safer? to try than a traditional cigarette? #beingconscious | 8 | If I remember correctly from my research a while back, the components in ecigs' juices are safe for consumption, but not known to be for terms of vapor being inhaled. To me, it's the same concept of trying to smoke let's say..vegetable oil. It's healthy for other purposes, but smoke is still smoke, and puffing on it doesn't sound smart. However, I may be the only one here who feels vapor is the lesser evil of smoking. To me, the known chemicals in them sound less harmful than the ones in actual cigarettes, and using vapor vs. Smoke, my symptoms with mucus and tight chest have lightened. I do however recognize, there is no saying the chemical reaction being far worse or that somehow vapor radiates our orifices or lungs. All around though, I have to say smoking in whatever form is bad, if not for the way it's consumed, then for the chemical reactions it has with our brain's chemistry. Nicotine is nicotine. Long rant like post, but I tried to cut it back, I'm passionate on this subject. | 2015-07-05T00:32:23+0000

10373 | Participant | TSP daily post response comment |  | #motivation | 3 | #3: How would you support someone who tells you they want to quit smoking? #motivation | 2 | Well I would work together with them to help them reduce the stress in their life that causes their smoking, on top of that I would help them find things to do that distract them from the urge | 2015-07-03T19:04:14+0000

10351 | Participant | TSP daily post response comment |  | #motivation | 3 | #3: How would you support someone who tells you they want to quit smoking? #motivation | 4 | I would help them make a plan. Then help them set a goal and ways to achieve that goal. And support them when they are having a hard time staying on track. | 2015-07-03T19:05:53+0000
10365 | Participant | TSP daily post response comment |  | #motivation | 3 | #3: How would you support someone who tells you they want to quit smoking? #motivation | 5 | I would show them the statistics for quitting smoking, provide tons of info and help them set up a plan to follow that would hopefully be successful for them. I would keep pushing them until they got to where they wanted to be. | 2015-07-03T19:22:15+0000
10356 | Participant | TSP daily post response comment |  | #motivation | 3 | #3: How would you support someone who tells you they want to quit smoking? #motivation | 6 | I have helped out a few friends who have quit smoking by reminding them what a they're doing if they try to have a cigarette and I'll take the rest away from them. They would get mad at me but they got over it :p | 2015-07-03T19:25:25+0000
10346 | Participant | TSP daily post response comment |  | #motivation | 3 | #3: How would you support someone who tells you they want to quit smoking? #motivation | 7 | I am really bad at this. I've had people ask me to help them quit, and none of them have actually quit. I would remind them that they asked me to help them quit if I saw them having a cigarette after the fact and try to keep them occupied with other methods of stress relief or what have you. But eventually it would get to a point where they would say they nnneeeeeeeddded one and I would cave. I've tried quitting with people and outlasted most of them. I guess I'm not the best support system when I comes to that and apparently neither are my friends lol. | 2015-07-03T20:11:22+0000
10340 | Participant | TSP daily post response comment |  | #motivation | 3 | #3: How would you support someone who tells you they want to quit smoking? #motivation | 8 | Just support them! Quitting is a personal and very difficult decision for a lot of people. Just having the support of a good friend can help someone thinking of relapsing | 2015-07-03T20:55:33+0000
n/a | Participant | TSP daily post response comment |  | #motivation | 3 | #3: How would you support someone who tells you they want to quit smoking? #motivation | 9 | I feel quitting with someone could greatly help because, at least to me, seeing or smelling someone else smoke makes the urge to smoke a lot stronger. | 2015-07-03T21:31:49+0000
10345 | Participant | TSP daily post response comment |  | #motivation | 3 | #3: How would you support someone who tells you they want to quit smoking? #motivation | 10 | I would honestly try my best to quit with them since I also want to quit or at least refrain from smoking when I am near or around them because I know for me the smell of a cigarette or seeing someone smoke a cigarette also makes me want to smoke. If they have specific reasons as to why they want to quit I would try to keep reminding them of that. I would also try to have like a task or something for us to accomplish before smoking if they said they wanted one. That usually works for me, or at least helps me to prolong the time from when I want one to when I actually smoke one. | 2015-07-04T02:17:05+0000

I think it's stupid here in my state smoking in an enclosed vehicle with a child under 6 or 60lbs is only punishable by a 25 dollar fine. What we as adults choose to do with our own bodies is one thing. Who the heck has to be told don't smoke in an enclosed space with your children? | 2015-07-02T19:25:48+0000

The thing I founf very interesting is all of these can be voided if the person is doing a theatrical performance in said venue (with authorization of the venue of course). | 2015-07-02T20:27:55+0000

It took me to realize that my habits were affecting my girlfriend's health to see it wasn't worth it. I've been cutting back by using a vape and lowering the nicotine level, now when I smoke a cigarette I end up feeling sick..a bittersweet victory in the making. I'm glad to see I'm not alone with the challenge though! | 2015-06-29T23:41:34+0000

Please feel free to like or respond to each others' comments and share any relevant content of your own. To begin, let's take a moment to get to know each other a little better. Feel free to share with us:• Where you come from• Anything about your smoking (how much, how often, when you first started, etc.)• What you hope to gain from participating in the Tobacco Study ProjectThank you! We hope you're as excited as we are! | 8 | Hi, I know this a couple days late. I'm 10346 I started smoking when I was 18. I'm 22 now. I used to like smoking. It was a social thing at my college. Everyone did it and it was an excellent way to make friends. Now that I don't go there anymore it doesn't have such an appeal. I'm hoping this group will help me give up this awful habit. | 2015-07-01T20:15:30+0000

Is there anyway to help stop or lessen these? | 1 | Hi 10351 - that sounds pretty uncomfortable! To me this sounds like withdrawal symptoms. How many cigs do you usually smoke each day? Have you thought about using nicotine replacement therapy (patch, gum)? They can really help decrease to withdrawal. | 2015-07-09T00:07:39+0000
10351 | Participant | User generated post response comment |  | n/a |  | When I have tried to stop smoking in the past I get really intense, horrible shakes.

I've tried the patches and they seem to really affect my moods | 2015-07-09T00:38:27+0000

Have you ever used the gum at all? It's easier to dose because you can just chew one whenever you feel like it and don't have to use it constantly like the patch. What do you think about that? | 2015-07-09T00:44:18+0000

Is there any that you could recommend? | 2015-07-09T00:46:12+0000

I've set quit dates before and tried to push myself to be fully quit by then and when I'm not completely quit by then it really brings me down and starts me full blown smoking again. | 2015-07-09T00:59:45+0000

I've been talking about quiting with my fiance a lot lately ( we both smoke) but he doesn't really want to quit and I do so it's been a little bit of a stuggle. I think the gradually reducing of smoking is my best method. Also when I've tried to stop in the past I've replaced the oral fixation with peppermint hard candy. This seems to help a little as well but it's really when my anxiety flares that I have a hard time keeping to quitting smoking. That and the horrible shakes I get every time I've tried to quit. | 2015-07-09T01:11:16+0000

Do you know why that might be? | 1 | Great question 10346 - I think it depends a lot on your preference. Both methods can work, but setting a quit date and pulling through is easier for many people to stick to, simply because you can't extend it indefinitely like cutting back. But really either method can work. What are you leaning toward? | 2015-07-09T00:41:57+0000

Do you know why that might be? | 2 | As for your other question, how did you chew your nicotine gum? Did you follow these instructions? Use the “Chew and Park? method: Chew the gum slowly until you can taste the nicotine or feel a tingling sensation in your mouth. Stop chewing and park the piece of gum between your cheek and gums. After about a minute, when the tingling is almost gone, start chewing again. Repeat this process until the tingle is gone (about 30 minutes). | 2015-07-09T00:42:44+0000

Also, I've tried the gum but something about it makes my entire mouth sting. Do you know why that might be? | 3 | I've tried both methods. Just flat out quitting seemed to work the best for me but I got headaches and was very on edge until I broke down and smoked. Cutting back is what I've said I've been doing for the past few months so I guess that's not really working at all. Lol. I think setting a date is an excellent plan, the few times I've tried quitting it was really just an in the moment desicion. Usually when I ran out of cigarettes or something. | 2015-07-09T00:51:01+0000

It seemed like an odd thing to me. All it really told me was to chew a piece every two to three hours for 12 weeks. I've never heard of the "Chew and Park" method but I will definitely be giving it a try. Thank you for that. | 2015-07-09T00:53:25+0000

Does it count as quitting if I go from cigarettes to the gum?
