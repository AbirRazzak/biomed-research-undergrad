10009 | Participant | TSP other post response comment |  | #knowyourself |  | If you labeled yourself as a nonsmoker, how would your self-image change? How would you see yourself differently if you no longer smoked? #knowyourself | 1 | It's already changing. I feel better in general. I don't smell bad, my teeth have gotten so much whiter. Just feels good but I'm still smoking, just less than five a day now. Yesterday I had five cigarettes and only 2ml of juice containing a 9mg mix. So way less than the 25/30 I was averaging! | 2014-12-30T17:58:56+0000

Did you have to face any specific cravings or smoking triggers? | 2 | I've got to run, but before I take off, I wanted to leave you some ideas for a stress reduction technique that is very helpful in my experience: Imagery means picturing or imagining something in your mind. Find somewhere quiet where you can be alone. Visualize a scene that makes you feel more relaxed. Then, focus on your senses (what do you see? Hear? Smell? Taste? Feel against your skin?)Here are some other ideas just for fun | 2014-12-04T02:03:11+0000

This is a sort of question I get quite often in the TSP groups. Some suggestions would be to find a low calorie snack, some people really like celery, for example. Sugar free gum is another great alternative. If you are interested in nicotine replacement therapy, you could also use a nicotine gum.

1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TSP other post response comment |  | n/a |  | Hi guys, let me know if you have any questions! I will be online for the next hour. | 6 | You know, if you quit smoking, it is actually pretty normal that the lung will try to get rid of all toxins initially - this should get better within a couple of weeks. Starting a modest sports regimen can help you rebuilding your lung capacity (walking/jogging, swimming, joga is great, too because of the focus on breathing). Drinking lots of water or herbal tea will help you to flush the toxins from your body (even though that may not directly clean your lungs). | 2014-11-20T22:55:59+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TSP other post response comment |  | n/a |  | Hi guys, let me know if you have any questions! I will be online for the next hour. | 7 | Ok guys, I've got to run. Feel free to leave additional comments if anything comes up during the week. Since some of the posts last week were about e-cigarettes, I wanted to give you some additional information before I take off: The problem with e-cigs is that there is no clear data up to now showing that they really help smokers quit. Also, they are not regulated by the FDA, which means that it is unclear what is in them. For all we know, they may still be harmful to your health. I would recommend using nicotine replacement therapy: gum, patch, inhaler (prescription), or lozenge (prescription). Also, other prescription medication like zyban or chantix can be effective, but you have to talk to your doctor first to get a prescription. I recommend trying one of these options before trying an e-cig.Check this for additional information http://smokefree.gov/e-cigarettes. | 2014-11-20T23:04:49+0000

10009 | Participant | TSP other post response comment |  | n/a |  |  | 1 | Not sure if I'll be on so I'll ask my question here, what do you know about nrt lozenges effectiveness? I resort to smoking a cigarette at work to get rid of my headache so I can actually work but I'm wondering if this would help that.. | 2015-01-21T17:32:45+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TSP other post response comment | 10009  | n/a |  |  | 2 | Hi 10009, first off it's great that your are trying to quit/reduce your smoking. Keep up the good work! The lozenge is definitely at least as effective for smoking cessation as other nicotine replacement products and I think it could be a good option for helping with your withdrawal symptoms. You can get it over the counter at a pharmacy and it even comes in different flavors like mint or cherry. Do you think you will give it a try? | 2015-01-22T01:11:25+0000

Even if I don't end up quitting completely for a long time it's still better to vape at least for me. I can breathe better, smell more, taste more, I smell better my teeth are whiter.

Since 2014 is almost over, it may be interesting to check out how much money you spent on smoking. What do you think? You can check this calculator to see how close your estimates are: https://www.quitnow.net/.../Calculator/CostSavings.aspxHow close were your estimates to the calculator? Were the costs more or less than you expected? | 2014-12-18T02:06:34+0000

1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TSP other post response comment | 10009  | n/a |  | Hi guys, let me know if you have any questions! I will be online for the next hour. | 2 | Great question 10009! This is a sort of question I get quite often in the TSP groups. Some suggestions would be to find a low calorie snack, some people really like celery, for example. Sugar free gum is another great alternative. If you are interested in nicotine replacement therapy, you could also use a nicotine gum. Any of these sound like they could be an option for you? | 2014-11-20T22:20:43+0000

1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TSP other post response comment |  | n/a |  | Hi guys, let me know if you have any questions! I will be online for the next hour. | 6 | You know, if you quit smoking, it is actually pretty normal that the lung will try to get rid of all toxins initially - this should get better within a couple of weeks. Starting a modest sports regimen can help you rebuilding your lung capacity (walking/jogging, swimming, joga is great, too because of the focus on breathing). Drinking lots of water or herbal tea will help you to flush the toxins from your body (even though that may not directly clean your lungs). | 2014-11-20T22:55:59+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TSP other post response comment |  | n/a |  | Hi guys, let me know if you have any questions! I will be online for the next hour. | 7 | Ok guys, I've got to run. Feel free to leave additional comments if anything comes up during the week. Since some of the posts last week were about e-cigarettes, I wanted to give you some additional information before I take off: The problem with e-cigs is that there is no clear data up to now showing that they really help smokers quit. Also, they are not regulated by the FDA, which means that it is unclear what is in them. For all we know, they may still be harmful to your health. I would recommend using nicotine replacement therapy: gum, patch, inhaler (prescription), or lozenge (prescription). Also, other prescription medication like zyban or chantix can be effective, but you have to talk to your doctor first to get a prescription. I recommend trying one of these options before trying an e-cig.Check this for additional information http://smokefree.gov/e-cigarettes. | 2014-11-20T23:04:49+0000

10009 | Participant | TSP other post response comment |  | #motivation |  | How would you support someone who tells you they want to quit smoking? #motivation | 1 | I simply don't smoke in their presence. In addition I don't let them bum from me. I'll also refrain from smoking in my car and I use a scent if I'm going to be around them. | 2014-11-09T20:34:01+0000

I read that the local colleges are all smoke free now. I don't think I would have been able to do that when I was in school. It took thirty minutes to get back to my car. Can't imagine taking forty minutes out of my day for one smoke. | 2014-11-09T01:45:04+0000

He will answer questions that you have about quitting smoking, provide support and group counseling, and provide resources for you in your journey to quitting. Regarding the money from the initial survey, you should have already received that, so we can look into that for you if you have not yet received it. | 2014-11-07T22:19:36+0000

1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TSP other post response comment | 10009  | n/a |  |  | 2 | Hi 10009, first off it's great that your are trying to quit/reduce your smoking. Keep up the good work! The lozenge is definitely at least as effective for smoking cessation as other nicotine replacement products and I think it could be a good option for helping with your withdrawal symptoms. You can get it over the counter at a pharmacy and it even comes in different flavors like mint or cherry. Do you think you will give it a try? | 2015-01-22T01:11:25+0000

Seeing the posts daily really helped remind me to keep trying. Though I'm still a smoker I've managed to go from a pack and a half a day to two packs a WEEK.

10009 | Participant | TSP other post response comment |  | #beingconscious |  | What have you heard about nicotine gum? How do you think the gum will help you? #beingconscious | 1 | I tried the gum but just couldn't do it. I got a really nice vapor system for Christmas and I've gone from 26 cigarettes on average to 4 in the last day. They stink so bad, don't even taste good. I'm going to step down the nicotine in the juice and hopefully soon I'll be down to 0mg & 0 cigarettes then just stop altogether. | 2014-12-26T16:39:59+0000

Find somewhere quiet where you can be alone. Visualize a scene that makes you feel more relaxed. Then, focus on your senses (what do you see? Hear? Smell? Taste? Feel against your skin?)Here are some other ideas just for fun | 2014-12-04T02:03:11+0000

This is a sort of question I get quite often in the TSP groups. Some suggestions would be to find a low calorie snack, some people really like celery, for example. Sugar free gum is another great alternative. If you are interested in nicotine replacement therapy, you could also use a nicotine gum.

I will be online for the next hour. | 6 | You know, if you quit smoking, it is actually pretty normal that the lung will try to get rid of all toxins initially - this should get better within a couple of weeks. Starting a modest sports regimen can help you rebuilding your lung capacity (walking/jogging, swimming, joga is great, too because of the focus on breathing). Drinking lots of water or herbal tea will help you to flush the toxins from your body (even though that may not directly clean your lungs). | 2014-11-20T22:55:59+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TSP other post response comment |  | n/a |  | Hi guys, let me know if you have any questions! I will be online for the next hour. | 7 | Ok guys, I've got to run. Feel free to leave additional comments if anything comes up during the week. Since some of the posts last week were about e-cigarettes, I wanted to give you some additional information before I take off: The problem with e-cigs is that there is no clear data up to now showing that they really help smokers quit. Also, they are not regulated by the FDA, which means that it is unclear what is in them. For all we know, they may still be harmful to your health. I would recommend using nicotine replacement therapy: gum, patch, inhaler (prescription), or lozenge (prescription). Also, other prescription medication like zyban or chantix can be effective, but you have to talk to your doctor first to get a prescription. I recommend trying one of these options before trying an e-cig.Check this for additional information http://smokefree.gov/e-cigarettes. | 2014-11-20T23:04:49+0000

1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TSP other post response comment | 10009  | n/a |  |  | 2 | Hi 10009, first off it's great that your are trying to quit/reduce your smoking. Keep up the good work! The lozenge is definitely at least as effective for smoking cessation as other nicotine replacement products and I think it could be a good option for helping with your withdrawal symptoms. You can get it over the counter at a pharmacy and it even comes in different flavors like mint or cherry. Do you think you will give it a try? | 2015-01-22T01:11:25+0000

10009 | Participant | TSP other post response comment |  | n/a |  | Hi guys, let me know if you have any questions! I will be online for the next hour. | 1 | I'm more addicted to the action of smoking. Actually bringing the thing to my mouth. Any suggestions so I don't end up eating a lot? | 2014-11-20T22:14:26+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TSP other post response comment | 10009  | n/a |  | Hi guys, let me know if you have any questions! I will be online for the next hour. | 2 | Great question 10009! This is a sort of question I get quite often in the TSP groups. Some suggestions would be to find a low calorie snack, some people really like celery, for example. Sugar free gum is another great alternative. If you are interested in nicotine replacement therapy, you could also use a nicotine gum. Any of these sound like they could be an option for you? | 2014-11-20T22:20:43+0000

1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TSP other post response comment |  | n/a |  | Hi guys, let me know if you have any questions! I will be online for the next hour. | 6 | You know, if you quit smoking, it is actually pretty normal that the lung will try to get rid of all toxins initially - this should get better within a couple of weeks. Starting a modest sports regimen can help you rebuilding your lung capacity (walking/jogging, swimming, joga is great, too because of the focus on breathing). Drinking lots of water or herbal tea will help you to flush the toxins from your body (even though that may not directly clean your lungs). | 2014-11-20T22:55:59+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TSP other post response comment |  | n/a |  | Hi guys, let me know if you have any questions! I will be online for the next hour. | 7 | Ok guys, I've got to run. Feel free to leave additional comments if anything comes up during the week. Since some of the posts last week were about e-cigarettes, I wanted to give you some additional information before I take off: The problem with e-cigs is that there is no clear data up to now showing that they really help smokers quit. Also, they are not regulated by the FDA, which means that it is unclear what is in them. For all we know, they may still be harmful to your health. I would recommend using nicotine replacement therapy: gum, patch, inhaler (prescription), or lozenge (prescription). Also, other prescription medication like zyban or chantix can be effective, but you have to talk to your doctor first to get a prescription. I recommend trying one of these options before trying an e-cig.Check this for additional information http://smokefree.gov/e-cigarettes. | 2014-11-20T23:04:49+0000

10009 | Participant | TSP other post response comment |  | n/a |  |  | 1 | Not sure if I'll be on so I'll ask my question here, what do you know about nrt lozenges effectiveness? I resort to smoking a cigarette at work to get rid of my headache so I can actually work but I'm wondering if this would help that.. | 2015-01-21T17:32:45+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TSP other post response comment | 10009  | n/a |  |  | 2 | Hi 10009, first off it's great that your are trying to quit/reduce your smoking. Keep up the good work! The lozenge is definitely at least as effective for smoking cessation as other nicotine replacement products and I think it could be a good option for helping with your withdrawal symptoms. You can get it over the counter at a pharmacy and it even comes in different flavors like mint or cherry. Do you think you will give it a try? | 2015-01-22T01:11:25+0000

This is a sort of question I get quite often in the TSP groups. Some suggestions would be to find a low calorie snack, some people really like celery, for example. Sugar free gum is another great alternative. If you are interested in nicotine replacement therapy, you could also use a nicotine gum. Any of these sound like they could be an option for you? | 2014-11-20T22:20:43+0000

I will be online for the next hour. | 6 | You know, if you quit smoking, it is actually pretty normal that the lung will try to get rid of all toxins initially - this should get better within a couple of weeks. Starting a modest sports regimen can help you rebuilding your lung capacity (walking/jogging, swimming, joga is great, too because of the focus on breathing). Drinking lots of water or herbal tea will help you to flush the toxins from your body (even though that may not directly clean your lungs). | 2014-11-20T22:55:59+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TSP other post response comment |  | n/a |  | Hi guys, let me know if you have any questions! I will be online for the next hour. | 7 | Ok guys, I've got to run. Feel free to leave additional comments if anything comes up during the week. Since some of the posts last week were about e-cigarettes, I wanted to give you some additional information before I take off: The problem with e-cigs is that there is no clear data up to now showing that they really help smokers quit. Also, they are not regulated by the FDA, which means that it is unclear what is in them. For all we know, they may still be harmful to your health. I would recommend using nicotine replacement therapy: gum, patch, inhaler (prescription), or lozenge (prescription). Also, other prescription medication like zyban or chantix can be effective, but you have to talk to your doctor first to get a prescription. I recommend trying one of these options before trying an e-cig.Check this for additional information http://smokefree.gov/e-cigarettes. | 2014-11-20T23:04:49+0000

Best case if I quit smoking I'd be able to breathe better. It doesn't really cost me much because I roll my own. I feel like I'm the only one participating in this "group". Btw. Still waiting for the first gift card. If others are still waiting I don't blame them for not participating. | 2014-11-12T01:42:09+0000

1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TSP other post response comment | 10009  | n/a |  |  | 2 | Hi 10009, first off it's great that your are trying to quit/reduce your smoking. Keep up the good work! The lozenge is definitely at least as effective for smoking cessation as other nicotine replacement products and I think it could be a good option for helping with your withdrawal symptoms. You can get it over the counter at a pharmacy and it even comes in different flavors like mint or cherry. Do you think you will give it a try? | 2015-01-22T01:11:25+0000

E cigs aren't better for you but it makes it easier to quit. I'm doing the vape sticks that use juice and that way I'm controlling my nicotine too. Hopefully in a few months I'll be completely off nicotine and cigarettes! | 2014-12-29T23:00:55+0000

Did you have to face any specific cravings or smoking triggers? | 2 | I've got to run, but before I take off, I wanted to leave you some ideas for a stress reduction technique that is very helpful in my experience: Imagery means picturing or imagining something in your mind. Find somewhere quiet where you can be alone. Visualize a scene that makes you feel more relaxed. Then, focus on your senses (what do you see? Hear? Smell? Taste? Feel against your skin?)Here are some other ideas just for fun | 2014-12-04T02:03:11+0000

This is a sort of question I get quite often in the TSP groups. Some suggestions would be to find a low calorie snack, some people really like celery, for example. Sugar free gum is another great alternative. If you are interested in nicotine replacement therapy, you could also use a nicotine gum. Any of these sound like they could be an option for you? | 2014-11-20T22:20:43+0000

1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TSP other post response comment |  | n/a |  | Hi guys, let me know if you have any questions! I will be online for the next hour. | 6 | You know, if you quit smoking, it is actually pretty normal that the lung will try to get rid of all toxins initially - this should get better within a couple of weeks. Starting a modest sports regimen can help you rebuilding your lung capacity (walking/jogging, swimming, joga is great, too because of the focus on breathing). Drinking lots of water or herbal tea will help you to flush the toxins from your body (even though that may not directly clean your lungs). | 2014-11-20T22:55:59+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TSP other post response comment |  | n/a |  | Hi guys, let me know if you have any questions! I will be online for the next hour. | 7 | Ok guys, I've got to run. Feel free to leave additional comments if anything comes up during the week. Since some of the posts last week were about e-cigarettes, I wanted to give you some additional information before I take off: The problem with e-cigs is that there is no clear data up to now showing that they really help smokers quit. Also, they are not regulated by the FDA, which means that it is unclear what is in them. For all we know, they may still be harmful to your health. I would recommend using nicotine replacement therapy: gum, patch, inhaler (prescription), or lozenge (prescription). Also, other prescription medication like zyban or chantix can be effective, but you have to talk to your doctor first to get a prescription. I recommend trying one of these options before trying an e-cig.Check this for additional information http://smokefree.gov/e-cigarettes. | 2014-11-20T23:04:49+0000

10009 | Participant | TSP other post response comment |  | n/a |  |  | 1 | Not sure if I'll be on so I'll ask my question here, what do you know about nrt lozenges effectiveness? I resort to smoking a cigarette at work to get rid of my headache so I can actually work but I'm wondering if this would help that.. | 2015-01-21T17:32:45+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TSP other post response comment | 10009  | n/a |  |  | 2 | Hi 10009, first off it's great that your are trying to quit/reduce your smoking. Keep up the good work! The lozenge is definitely at least as effective for smoking cessation as other nicotine replacement products and I think it could be a good option for helping with your withdrawal symptoms. You can get it over the counter at a pharmacy and it even comes in different flavors like mint or cherry. Do you think you will give it a try? | 2015-01-22T01:11:25+0000

What chain reaction would you set off? #smokingaffectsall | 1 | My fiance is trying to quit smoking and move to vaping now. I wound up telling her she stinks and she immediately started cutting back and bought a vape pen | 2015-01-07T00:27:15+0000

How many can you think of? #balance | 1 | I can think of so many and I've listed them here before. Even if I don't end up quitting completely for a long time it's still better to vape at least for me. I can breathe better, smell more, taste more, I smell better my teeth are whiter. And I've actually lost weight because I'm more active since I can breathe a lot better. | 2015-01-04T18:53:41+0000

I will be online for the next hour. | 1 | I'm more addicted to the action of smoking. Actually bringing the thing to my mouth. Any suggestions so I don't end up eating a lot? | 2014-11-20T22:14:26+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TSP other post response comment | 10009  | n/a |  | Hi guys, let me know if you have any questions! I will be online for the next hour. | 2 | Great question 10009! This is a sort of question I get quite often in the TSP groups. Some suggestions would be to find a low calorie snack, some people really like celery, for example. Sugar free gum is another great alternative. If you are interested in nicotine replacement therapy, you could also use a nicotine gum. Any of these sound like they could be an option for you? | 2014-11-20T22:20:43+0000

1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TSP other post response comment |  | n/a |  | Hi guys, let me know if you have any questions! I will be online for the next hour. | 6 | You know, if you quit smoking, it is actually pretty normal that the lung will try to get rid of all toxins initially - this should get better within a couple of weeks. Starting a modest sports regimen can help you rebuilding your lung capacity (walking/jogging, swimming, joga is great, too because of the focus on breathing). Drinking lots of water or herbal tea will help you to flush the toxins from your body (even though that may not directly clean your lungs). | 2014-11-20T22:55:59+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TSP other post response comment |  | n/a |  | Hi guys, let me know if you have any questions! I will be online for the next hour. | 7 | Ok guys, I've got to run. Feel free to leave additional comments if anything comes up during the week. Since some of the posts last week were about e-cigarettes, I wanted to give you some additional information before I take off: The problem with e-cigs is that there is no clear data up to now showing that they really help smokers quit. Also, they are not regulated by the FDA, which means that it is unclear what is in them. For all we know, they may still be harmful to your health. I would recommend using nicotine replacement therapy: gum, patch, inhaler (prescription), or lozenge (prescription). Also, other prescription medication like zyban or chantix can be effective, but you have to talk to your doctor first to get a prescription. I recommend trying one of these options before trying an e-cig.Check this for additional information http://smokefree.gov/e-cigarettes. | 2014-11-20T23:04:49+0000

Who helped? #motivation | 1 | The most recent big success I can think of is landing my last job. It was obviously a success, I love what I do, who I work with and I'm great at my job. Pay isn't bad either. My father was a large part in this, providing the transportation I needed until I could afford a car for the 75 mile round trip daily. | 2014-11-08T15:48:32+0000

He will answer questions that you have about quitting smoking, provide support and group counseling, and provide resources for you in your journey to quitting. Regarding the money from the initial survey, you should have already received that, so we can look into that for you if you have not yet received it. | 2014-11-07T22:19:36+0000

10009 | Participant | TSP other post response comment |  | n/a |  |  | 1 | Not sure if I'll be on so I'll ask my question here, what do you know about nrt lozenges effectiveness? I resort to smoking a cigarette at work to get rid of my headache so I can actually work but I'm wondering if this would help that.. | 2015-01-21T17:32:45+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TSP other post response comment | 10009  | n/a |  |  | 2 | Hi 10009, first off it's great that your are trying to quit/reduce your smoking. Keep up the good work! The lozenge is definitely at least as effective for smoking cessation as other nicotine replacement products and I think it could be a good option for helping with your withdrawal symptoms. You can get it over the counter at a pharmacy and it even comes in different flavors like mint or cherry. Do you think you will give it a try? | 2015-01-22T01:11:25+0000

They think why would they make a harmful substance in a lab to be inhaled | 2014-12-02T01:34:53+0000

This is a sort of question I get quite often in the TSP groups. Some suggestions would be to find a low calorie snack, some people really like celery, for example. Sugar free gum is another great alternative. If you are interested in nicotine replacement therapy, you could also use a nicotine gum. Any of these sound like they could be an option for you? | 2014-11-20T22:20:43+0000

I will be online for the next hour. | 6 | You know, if you quit smoking, it is actually pretty normal that the lung will try to get rid of all toxins initially - this should get better within a couple of weeks. Starting a modest sports regimen can help you rebuilding your lung capacity (walking/jogging, swimming, joga is great, too because of the focus on breathing). Drinking lots of water or herbal tea will help you to flush the toxins from your body (even though that may not directly clean your lungs). | 2014-11-20T22:55:59+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TSP other post response comment |  | n/a |  | Hi guys, let me know if you have any questions! I will be online for the next hour. | 7 | Ok guys, I've got to run. Feel free to leave additional comments if anything comes up during the week. Since some of the posts last week were about e-cigarettes, I wanted to give you some additional information before I take off: The problem with e-cigs is that there is no clear data up to now showing that they really help smokers quit. Also, they are not regulated by the FDA, which means that it is unclear what is in them. For all we know, they may still be harmful to your health. I would recommend using nicotine replacement therapy: gum, patch, inhaler (prescription), or lozenge (prescription). Also, other prescription medication like zyban or chantix can be effective, but you have to talk to your doctor first to get a prescription. I recommend trying one of these options before trying an e-cig.Check this for additional information http://smokefree.gov/e-cigarettes. | 2014-11-20T23:04:49+0000

Best case if I quit smoking I'd be able to breathe better. It doesn't really cost me much because I roll my own. I feel like I'm the only one participating in this "group". Btw.

1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TSP other post response comment | 10009  | n/a |  |  | 2 | Hi 10009, first off it's great that your are trying to quit/reduce your smoking. Keep up the good work! The lozenge is definitely at least as effective for smoking cessation as other nicotine replacement products and I think it could be a good option for helping with your withdrawal symptoms. You can get it over the counter at a pharmacy and it even comes in different flavors like mint or cherry. Do you think you will give it a try? | 2015-01-22T01:11:25+0000

How would you see yourself differently if you no longer smoked? #knowyourself | 1 | It's already changing. I feel better in general. I don't smell bad, my teeth have gotten so much whiter. Just feels good but I'm still smoking, just less than five a day now. Yesterday I had five cigarettes and only 2ml of juice containing a 9mg mix. So way less than the 25/30 I was averaging! | 2014-12-30T17:58:56+0000

How does it feel to see our society moving towards a tobacco free mindset? #smoking affects all | 1 | It's always the same people urging. It's kinda pointless after awhile. You stop paying attention. I mean really there should not be anyone smoking who isn't aware of possible consequences. You can't avoid learning. It's just people stop caring. We already know it's bad | 2014-12-09T17:13:24+0000

Find somewhere quiet where you can be alone. Visualize a scene that makes you feel more relaxed. Then, focus on your senses (what do you see? Hear? Smell? Taste? Feel against your skin?)Here are some other ideas just for fun | 2014-12-04T02:03:11+0000

I will be online for the next hour. | 6 | You know, if you quit smoking, it is actually pretty normal that the lung will try to get rid of all toxins initially - this should get better within a couple of weeks. Starting a modest sports regimen can help you rebuilding your lung capacity (walking/jogging, swimming, joga is great, too because of the focus on breathing). Drinking lots of water or herbal tea will help you to flush the toxins from your body (even though that may not directly clean your lungs). | 2014-11-20T22:55:59+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TSP other post response comment |  | n/a |  | Hi guys, let me know if you have any questions! I will be online for the next hour. | 7 | Ok guys, I've got to run. Feel free to leave additional comments if anything comes up during the week. Since some of the posts last week were about e-cigarettes, I wanted to give you some additional information before I take off: The problem with e-cigs is that there is no clear data up to now showing that they really help smokers quit. Also, they are not regulated by the FDA, which means that it is unclear what is in them. For all we know, they may still be harmful to your health. I would recommend using nicotine replacement therapy: gum, patch, inhaler (prescription), or lozenge (prescription). Also, other prescription medication like zyban or chantix can be effective, but you have to talk to your doctor first to get a prescription. I recommend trying one of these options before trying an e-cig.Check this for additional information http://smokefree.gov/e-cigarettes. | 2014-11-20T23:04:49+0000

10009 | Participant | TSP other post response comment |  | n/a |  |  | 1 | Not sure if I'll be on so I'll ask my question here, what do you know about nrt lozenges effectiveness? I resort to smoking a cigarette at work to get rid of my headache so I can actually work but I'm wondering if this would help that.. | 2015-01-21T17:32:45+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TSP other post response comment | 10009  | n/a |  |  | 2 | Hi 10009, first off it's great that your are trying to quit/reduce your smoking. Keep up the good work! The lozenge is definitely at least as effective for smoking cessation as other nicotine replacement products and I think it could be a good option for helping with your withdrawal symptoms. You can get it over the counter at a pharmacy and it even comes in different flavors like mint or cherry. Do you think you will give it a try? | 2015-01-22T01:11:25+0000

1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TSP other post response comment | 10009  | n/a |  | Hi guys, let me know if you have any questions! I will be online for the next hour. | 2 | Great question 10009! This is a sort of question I get quite often in the TSP groups. Some suggestions would be to find a low calorie snack, some people really like celery, for example. Sugar free gum is another great alternative. If you are interested in nicotine replacement therapy, you could also use a nicotine gum. Any of these sound like they could be an option for you? | 2014-11-20T22:20:43+0000

1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TSP other post response comment |  | n/a |  | Hi guys, let me know if you have any questions! I will be online for the next hour. | 6 | You know, if you quit smoking, it is actually pretty normal that the lung will try to get rid of all toxins initially - this should get better within a couple of weeks. Starting a modest sports regimen can help you rebuilding your lung capacity (walking/jogging, swimming, joga is great, too because of the focus on breathing). Drinking lots of water or herbal tea will help you to flush the toxins from your body (even though that may not directly clean your lungs). | 2014-11-20T22:55:59+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TSP other post response comment |  | n/a |  | Hi guys, let me know if you have any questions! I will be online for the next hour. | 7 | Ok guys, I've got to run. Feel free to leave additional comments if anything comes up during the week. Since some of the posts last week were about e-cigarettes, I wanted to give you some additional information before I take off: The problem with e-cigs is that there is no clear data up to now showing that they really help smokers quit. Also, they are not regulated by the FDA, which means that it is unclear what is in them. For all we know, they may still be harmful to your health. I would recommend using nicotine replacement therapy: gum, patch, inhaler (prescription), or lozenge (prescription). Also, other prescription medication like zyban or chantix can be effective, but you have to talk to your doctor first to get a prescription. I recommend trying one of these options before trying an e-cig.Check this for additional information http://smokefree.gov/e-cigarettes. | 2014-11-20T23:04:49+0000

Do any of you feel that if you were a minor, an e-cig would be more appealing and seem “safer? to try than a traditional cigarette? #being conscious | 1 | I would totally believe they are safer. If I were a kid again I could see these leading to a higher usage rate as the risk of getting caught by parents etc is so much lower compared to conventional cigarettes | 2014-11-10T19:56:17+0000

In addition I don't let them bum from me. I'll also refrain from smoking in my car and I use a scent if I'm going to be around them. | 2014-11-09T20:34:01+0000

I read that the local colleges are all smoke free now. I don't think I would have been able to do that when I was in school. It took thirty minutes to get back to my car. Can't imagine taking forty minutes out of my day for one smoke. | 2014-11-09T01:45:04+0000

He will answer questions that you have about quitting smoking, provide support and group counseling, and provide resources for you in your journey to quitting. Regarding the money from the initial survey, you should have already received that, so we can look into that for you if you have not yet received it. | 2014-11-07T22:19:36+0000

10009 | Participant | TSP other post response comment |  | n/a |  |  | 1 | Not sure if I'll be on so I'll ask my question here, what do you know about nrt lozenges effectiveness? I resort to smoking a cigarette at work to get rid of my headache so I can actually work but I'm wondering if this would help that.. | 2015-01-21T17:32:45+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TSP other post response comment | 10009  | n/a |  |  | 2 | Hi 10009, first off it's great that your are trying to quit/reduce your smoking. Keep up the good work! The lozenge is definitely at least as effective for smoking cessation as other nicotine replacement products and I think it could be a good option for helping with your withdrawal symptoms. You can get it over the counter at a pharmacy and it even comes in different flavors like mint or cherry. Do you think you will give it a try? | 2015-01-22T01:11:25+0000
