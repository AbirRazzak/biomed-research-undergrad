If not, what is getting in your way? | 1 | I like to leave you guys with tips in these session, so today, here is our 5-step TSP quit plan. See if something resonates with you: 1. GET READY.• Set a quit date and stick to it – not even a single puff! 2. GET SUPPORT AND ENCOURAGEMENT.• Tell your family, friends and coworkers you are quitting.• Talk to your doctor or other health care provider.• Get group, individual, or telephone counseling. Think about who can support you with quitting smoking3. LEARN NEW SKILLS AND BEHAVIORS.• When you first try to quit, change your routine.• Reduce stress.• Distract yourself from urges to smoke.• Plan something enjoyable to do every day.• Drink a lot of water and other fluids. Think about which of these will be most helpful to you?4. GET MEDICATION AND USE IT CORRECTLY.Talk with your health care provider about which medication will work best for you:• Medication: bupropion, verenicline (prescription).• Nicotine Replacement:-gum and patch are over-the-counter-inhaler and nasal spray are prescriptionIs there one of these that you think would be helpful for you?5. BE PREPARED FOR RELAPSE OR DIFFICULT SITUATIONS.• Avoid alcohol.• Be careful around other smokers.• Improve your mood in ways other than smoking.• Eat a healthy diet and stay active. | 2015-06-11T04:04:07+0000

10153 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | Have you ever noticed a connection between smoking and your mood? Is there an emotional state that gets you to light up more frequently? #TDII | 1 | I'd smoke if I were agitated, nervous, pissed off. Mood for sure plays a role in smoking | 2015-05-21T00:08:31+0000

Is there an emotional state that gets you to light up more frequently? #TDII | 2 | Agreed 10153 - those are big time triggers. Are you still quit? What kind of strategies do you use to cope with these situations without a cig? | 2015-05-21T00:11:31+0000
10153 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | Have you ever noticed a connection between smoking and your mood?

I haven't smoked but may 5 cigarettes since saturday. | 2015-05-21T00:15:01+0000

Is there an emotional state that gets you to light up more frequently? #TDII | 4 | Thanks for sharing 10153. Lapses can definitely be part of the smoking cessation process and it's normal to feel bad or ashamed about a lapse after it happened. What was the situation like? What triggered the smoking? And how do you plan to continue? | 2015-05-21T00:20:06+0000
10153 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | Have you ever noticed a connection between smoking and your mood? Is there an emotional state that gets you to light up more frequently? #TDII | 5 | Well. We were having a get together at my house. And I was drinking a little bit. That's a bad trigger for me but it was a celebration. And people were smoking so I joined in. | 2015-05-21T00:28:57+0000

Is there an emotional state that gets you to light up more frequently? #TDII | 10 | That's great! Just look at all the progress you have made since you first quit. You managed to stay smoke free for many weeks in a row and learned a lot about how to control your smoking. I think you should just go back to where you were before this lapse and stop smoking altogether again. Are you motivated to do that? If not what barriers are in the way? | 2015-05-21T00:39:41+0000

Have/would you ever try one? #ecig | 1 | I've tried a few of them, but it wasn't good for me. I enjoyed the 'smoke' that came out of it and the light that came on, but it had no end to it. When smoking a regular cigarette it has a time limit, unlike an ecig. I would constantly puff on it, and still did not get that satisfaction that I did when smoking a real one. | 2015-04-12T19:03:48+0000

It worked for a while actually, but what I didn't like was the nasty cold sores in my mouth. I didn't want holes in my gums either. | 2015-04-13T19:09:55+0000

10169 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | How does your smoking affect your loved ones, kids, or significant other? What do they think about your smoking? #TDII | 3 | It's going pretty well- I've chosen to substitute the morning cigarette for mouthwash although some mornings I have not done so good because those mornings had a rough start. I have given up smoking in the car completely and have done really well at waiting out a craving. | 2015-04-14T01:10:22+0000

I think it's pretty normal that not everything will work perfectly starting out, but you learn something new every day and are becoming more successful. Also, it's the fact that you are working on it that counts! Which are still the most difficult for you to get rid of? | 2015-04-14T01:14:47+0000

I will have to try harder to beat that one. | 2015-04-14T01:16:38+0000

10169 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | How does your smoking affect your loved ones, kids, or significant other? What do they think about your smoking? #TDII | 7 | I've just been trying distractions like playing with my baby, exercising and deep breathing. It's hard to resist the urge to smoke when you are in postpartum depression but I have been working really hard at it. I think that tomorrow I am going to limit the amount I smoke even more by setting out only three that I can have if I really want one for the entire day and night. I believe that will force me to get creative with my usual methods and do even better. My son has been more cheerful today which put me in a great mood so I haven't even used three cigarettes all day long. | 2015-04-14T01:30:38+0000

It's also great that you are noticing patterns in your daily mood and your smoking - this shows you that some pleasant activities each day can really help with reducing/quitting. I am logging off for today, but keep up the good work and try those creative strategies and I will check in with you next week to see how you are doing. Have a great week! | 2015-04-14T01:38:09+0000

We don't smoke around him but it's just time away from being with him when we wanted to take a smoke break. I am completely dedicated to throw this habit away. My girlfriend on the other hand is not as dedicated. Which doesn't help much with me. | 2015-04-14T01:48:04+0000

10169 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | How do you feel about your quitting now? Still feeling committed to becoming smoke free? #TDII | 1 | Yes- I still have the " want to" and I have cut down to about 4 cigarettes a day. I am feeling pretty good about it. | 2015-04-09T00:04:28+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment | 10169  | #TDII |  | How do you feel about your quitting now? Still feeling committed to becoming smoke free? #TDII | 2 | I am happy to hear that 10169! Good job! What strategy to cut down have you been using so far and how do you plan to cut down even further? | 2015-04-09T00:07:24+0000
10169 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | How do you feel about your quitting now? Still feeling committed to becoming smoke free? #TDII | 3 | I have been simply asking myself did I really want one or did I just want to stay in my routine and smoke when I usually do. I plan on continuing this until I feel I no longer really want one. It doesn't feel like a need- just a strong want. So as long as I cut back when I feel like I want one, I will be fine. | 2015-04-09T00:09:50+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment | 10169  | #TDII |  | How do you feel about your quitting now? Still feeling committed to becoming smoke free? #TDII | 4 | Very good 10169 - one thing I would like to mention: Cravings usually get a lot better after 5 min, so your strategy to ask yourself if you really want one is spot on. A lot of times the craving will just go away after a while. Here is a comprehensive list of other strategies I would like to share with you: http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/quit-smoking/in-depth/nicotine-craving/art-20045454 Anything you think may be useful for you? | 2015-04-09T00:14:55+0000
10169 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | How do you feel about your quitting now? Still feeling committed to becoming smoke free? #TDII | 5 | I believe that the getting physical and the distraction techniques are really working well for me. I can't really ask family for help (although they have been helping without knowing it) because I am one of those closet smokers like the article mentioned. Not a lot of people know about my habit because I conceal it well. That is why it won't be as hard for me to quit- when I am with people I don't want to know about my habit, I can go a few days without smoking, or however long I am around them. | 2015-04-09T00:22:07+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | How do you feel about your quitting now? Still feeling committed to becoming smoke free? #TDII | 6 | Great - good to hear that your family is providing support without even knowing :) Which cigarettes do you think will be the hardest for you to give up and what can you do to give them up anyway? | 2015-04-09T00:27:42+0000
10169 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | How do you feel about your quitting now? Still feeling committed to becoming smoke free? #TDII | 7 | Definitely the first one of the morning and when I have met my stress limit. I can just try to avoid the one in the morning and try some other relaxation method when I am stressed. | 2015-04-09T00:29:23+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment | 10169  | #TDII |  | How do you feel about your quitting now? Still feeling committed to becoming smoke free? #TDII | 8 | Those are great ideas 10169! I recommend to try deep breathing relaxation techniques for stressful situations. Also I think changing your routines may help. If you smoke your first one in the day in a particular situations (e.g., with your first coffee) try having your coffee in a different situations where you can't smoke - just an example but I think you know what I mean. How does this sound? | 2015-04-09T00:37:43+0000
10169 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | How do you feel about your quitting now? Still feeling committed to becoming smoke free? #TDII | 9 | That would be great if I did drink coffee lol! But no, it's the very first thing I do in the morning. I will just have to find a new thing to do when I first get up to get awake for the day. It sounds like a great idea to change what I do so that I can create a new routine. Thank you for the tip! | 2015-04-09T00:40:13+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | How do you feel about your quitting now? Still feeling committed to becoming smoke free? #TDII | 10 | Sure - you're welcome. Yes try it and let me know how it goes next week! Here are some additional tips for dealing with withdrawal that you may find helpful. Keep up the good work! | 2015-04-09T00:43:06+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | How do you feel about your quitting now? Still feeling committed to becoming smoke free? #TDII | 11 | One additional thought I have: Maybe you can try brushing your teeth or use mouthwash or something like that first thing when you get up and that first cigarette may not be as appealing anymore. Just an idea. | 2015-04-09T00:45:44+0000
10169 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | How do you feel about your quitting now? Still feeling committed to becoming smoke free? #TDII | 12 | Those tips are great although I will not be trying to eat candy as I don't like candy. I love juice and tea, and love to be active, so I will definitely be improving on those. I usually brush my teeth and mouthwash right after that cigarette, but I will skip that and just go straight to oral hygiene starting tomorrow. Thanks again and I will let you know how it goes. | 2015-04-09T00:49:37+0000

10153 | Participant | TSP daily post response comment |  | #freeyourself | 10 | #10: What are your top reasons for quitting? #freeyourself | 2 | 1. For my son. Would not like him to grow up to pick up a bad habit. 2. For my self. To prove that i can kick this habit goodbye. 4. For my health. We all know it's bad for you. I can't stand how hard to it to catch my breath now after doing so  little of anything streneous. I wanna be able to go jog with ought dying. Go to the gym without feeling so winded on leg day. 5. My family. If I can prove to them I can quit then the ones that do smoke can hopefully understand it's not as bad as it seems.6. My wallet. It's like bailing water out of an already sinking ship. I could spend my hard earned money on better things than a pack of smokes.7. I don't wanna smell like an ash tray anymore. 8. I don't want the smokers cough anymore. 9. I don't wanna miss out on anything anymore due to having to step ouside to have a smoke. 10. I don't want to feel like an addict anymore | 2015-03-29T21:37:05+0000

I just kept myself busy doing something else instead of using the time to smoke. | 2015-04-02T00:21:47+0000

I find that if I spend my time outside and have fun I don't think about it nearly as much. | 2015-04-02T00:23:36+0000

Do you smoke more or less? #TDII | 10 | Those are some spot on observations 10169! So it sounds like boredom and having nothing to do are really your high risk situations for smoking. It also sounds like getting outdoors is a very effective strategy for you to not smoke. What else could you do to distract yourself when you are craving a smoke and can't go on a hike for example? | 2015-04-02T00:28:24+0000

Do you smoke more or less? #TDII | 12 | Well honestly not really no one cares that I'm trying to quit. They just tell me I'ma going to fail and start smoking again but that's just motivation. I smoke the most when I'm at work. And you can smoke in the shop at anytime all day if you want. So it's easy to light one every few minutes if I want.So when I have the feeling of smoking, I just did something else like organize tools, sweep the floors, anything to get my mind off it. I don't really smoke much when I'm at home. | 2015-04-02T00:31:26+0000

Do you smoke more or less? #TDII | 14 | I am very motivated, but I have to take it slowly. I tried a couple of years ago to stop cold turkey- and I succeeded for 2 weeks. After that, though, I went through a bad case of pneumonia in both of my lungs and had to be hospitalized. I gave in to another craving after I got better, and now I'm stuck all over again. So this time I have to take it slowly so that doesn't happen again. | 2015-04-02T00:37:08+0000

And it's great that you are turning this into motivation to show everyone that they are wrong. We here at TSP certainly believe that you can do it! It sounds like you already have some great strategies to distract yourself. I also encourage you to use sugarfree gum, candy, toothpicks, or something like that to keep your mouth busy. Do you have family members or just friends you can call for support in difficult situations? | 2015-04-02T00:39:16+0000

Do you smoke more or less? #TDII | 16 | 10169, yes I understand. This does not sound like something you would want to happen again. What kind of strategy do you think could work for you? Using nicotine replacement (e.g. gum or patch)? Gradually reducing your number of cigarettes? Or something different altogether? | 2015-04-02T00:42:34+0000

Do you smoke more or less? #TDII | 17 | I believe that gradually reducing combined with extra effort to find distractions will work for me. I've tried replacements, but it's not about the nicotine so much as the habit of puffing that is my personal issue. The e cigs don't work either, because since they never go out I constantly puff them. | 2015-04-02T00:45:51+0000

Do you smoke more or less? #TDII | 18 | 10169 it's great to hear that you are motivated and willing to try gradually reducing. Some things you could try there: Pick certain cigarettes you want to eliminate (e.g. the first or last one each day, a cigarette after a meal), you could also think about declaring smoke free zones to get you to smoke less (e.g. stop smoking in your car). Yet another way would be to gradually increase the time interval between cigarettes. Which of these strategies may work for you? | 2015-04-02T00:53:13+0000

Let me know if you have any questions! #TDII | 2 | Good question 10153! Unfortunately there is nothing that suggests these kind of cigarettes that brand themselves as "organic" are any less dangerous or harmful, since the combustion of tobacco is really the harmful part. For all we know this is just a marketing twist of the tobacco industry.

Thank you.I have one more question for you.Which would you prefer the best way to quit smoking? I've been trying to just cold turkey stop, I've even tried using a vape, to no advantage. It seems very difficult to have the will to quit when I work in a shop where half the employees smoke freely when they want. | 2015-03-26T01:00:01+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | Hi everyone and welcome to TSP! I am available for the next hour. Let me know if you have any questions! #TDII | 5 | That’s the million dollar question :) There are several aspects to it: 1. I would recommend to pick a quit day and following through with it. 2. Get support from family/friends/colleagues. 3. Learn new skills and alternative behaviors for your high risk situations (sounds like breaks at work are those kinds of situations for you). 4. Depending on how much you smoke I would definitely recommend that you consider trying some form of nicotine replacement therapy – we know that using these can dramatically decrease your cravings and withdrawal and increase your chances to quit for good. 5. Be prepared for relapse or difficult situations (e.g., alcohol, being around other smokers, stress, etc.). I know this sounds like a lot, but we will cover each of these aspects more in depth over the next weeks. How does this sound? Anything there you think may be useful? | 2015-03-26T01:10:31+0000

Are you surprised? #beingconscious | 1 | My score is 4- Moderately Dependent. I am not really surprised, as I know that I don't HAVE to smoke nearly as often as most people, but I do have times where I don't want to give up the opportunity. I don't have a problem spending the whole day in a no smoking zone, but as soon as I get out I feel as though I need to smoke. | 2015-03-23T20:14:06+0000

GET SUPPORT AND ENCOURAGEMENT:- Tell your family, friends and coworkers you are quitting.- Talk to your doctor or other health care provider.- Get group, individual, or telephone counseling.Who can support you with quitting smoking? | 1 | 10153, I have thought a little more about what you told me yesterday, about how you don’t have people to support you in your quitting efforts. Two things came to mind: If you can’t get people to actively support you, you may at least be able to get them to not interfere with your quitting. For example you could ask them to not offer you cigarettes or to stop smoking while you are around. I have found that people are generally accepting when someone stakes a stand and communicates their decision assertively (we will also talk more about this one of the future sessions). Also, I encourage you to reach out to your fellow TSP group members and to TSP staff (e.g. me) if you need social support in difficult situations. I will also work with you some more on coming up with alternatives for smoking in high-risk situations. How does this sound? Any of these seem suggests seem like they may work for you? | 2015-04-03T00:58:04+0000

10132 | Participant | TSP other post response comment | 10132  | n/a |  |  | 1 | Hi my names 10132, so I normally smoke about a pack a day. Last week I was doing really well down to 2 cigarettes a day, but this week I'm back to normal, I feel like I failed. What tips do you have on sticking with it? | 2015-04-09T00:24:07+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TSP other post response comment | 10132  | n/a |  |  | 2 | Hi 10132 - this session is supposed to start tomorrow - but since I am online now I am going to give you a couple of recommendations. First of all: Great job! You were able to reduce your smoking quite dramatically for an entire week. You should focus on this accomplishment and I think that shows you that you can really do it if you want. I can try to help you being a bit more strategic about your next try. Here are 5 points I generally recommend (these are also listed in last weeks session): 1. Pick a quit day and following through with it. 2. Get support from family/friends/colleagues. 3. Learn new skills and alternative behaviors for your high risk situations. 4. I would definitely recommend that you consider trying some form of nicotine replacement therapy – we know that using these can dramatically decrease your cravings and withdrawal and increase your chances to quit for good. 5. Be prepared for relapse or difficult situations (e.g., alcohol, being around other smokers, stress, etc.). I know this sounds like a lot, but we can work on breaking them down into smaller steps. Any initial thoughts about any of this? Do you think some of these strategies may work for you? | 2015-04-09T00:35:13+0000
10132 | Participant | TSP other post response comment |  | n/a |  |  | 3 | Yes those 5 steps sound like a perfect guideline for me! Do you have any recommendations of nicotine replacement? | 2015-04-09T00:49:05+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TSP other post response comment |  | n/a |  |  | 4 | I generally recommend nicotine patch and gum. Lozenge is an option as well if you prefer that. All of these are available over the counter so you can get them at every pharmacy. State smoking quit lines can sometimes provide you with a free supply of patch and gum. You can google "your state" & quitline to find out more or call 1-800-QUITNOW. Do you think this is something you would want to try? | 2015-04-09T00:54:39+0000
10132 | Participant | TSP other post response comment |  | n/a |  |  | 5 | Yes, I haven't tried any nicotine replacement before. Your so helpful thank you! | 2015-04-09T00:57:51+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TSP other post response comment |  | n/a |  |  | 6 | Sure - anytime. Glad I can support you! I am about to go offline for today, but feel free to stop by tomorrow from 5.15-6 PM (Pacific) or next week and check out your local pharmacy or give the quitline a call! It's great that you have decided to try to quit smoking and we at TSP are here to help you! See you soon. | 2015-04-09T01:00:56+0000
