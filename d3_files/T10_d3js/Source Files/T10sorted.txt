What would you tell the kids about smoking? #knowyourself | 3 | I don't think they would invite someone who worked for big tobacco,  but I would just talk about being a business person not selling tobacco. | 2015-09-14T19:10:46+0000

From my clinical experience I would recommend trying NRT first. Those are the medications we know work for smoking cessation, for e-cigs we are not sure yet. We don't know if they are helpful and they may still be bad for your health (even though they are most likely less harmful then regular cigs). Have you been having any sort of withdrawal symptoms or cravings since you reduced? | 2015-08-27T03:42:26+0000

I've cut down from half a carton a day, to only 2 cigarettes a day. Granted, I'm puffing on my vape constantly, but it tastes better, I don't smell like smoke, it's cheaper beyond belief, and I feel like I'm breathing better! And 10378! Congrats on cutting back so far! :) And everyone else, I know that most of us are in this group for the pocket change, but I kind of wish we had a little more conversation going, if it's just me, I'll shut up, but I was really looking forward to a community for sharing tips, victories, and setbacks.

Do you think it's better for society as a whole to have smoke-free workplaces? #smokingaffectsall | 1 | Yes,  inside workplaces, because you don't want someone held against their will in a smoke filled room.  However I don't believe they should keep them from smoking in designated smoking areas.  It's a personal decision to smoke,  and it shouldn't be controlled by a company.  Obviously they just want to eradicate smoke breaks,  in the hopes of raising productivity. | 2015-08-18T19:07:40+0000

How does it feel to see our society moving towards a tobacco-free mindset? #smokingaffectsall | 3 | I feel as though it because of a need for more healthy propaganda that our society is moving towards a tobacoo-free mindset. Our society is gearing towards helathier choices for ourselves simply because the tobacco companies are coming under fire for losing lives instead of saving lives for our society. think about it. Think about all of the advertisements you see now for smoking cessation, especially for young adults. Didn't it used to be that all we saw was advertisements for actual cigarettes? | 2015-08-13T19:58:46+0000

This post is for you to make sure you understand that if you only comment on 6 out of 7 days a week, I can't count that week for you! Hopefully that answers some of your questions on how these incentives work.

I've actually tried sucking/nomming on a pen when having an urge to smoke (when I had no access to cigarettes) and it helped with the urge. | 2015-08-05T02:59:53+0000

Just another thing to spend your money on. Majority of people I know have bought the e-cigs and then went back to cigs so they basically paid for something that's a waste | 2015-08-05T19:04:07+0000

It gives me an excuse to step away and be alone for a moment. | 2015-08-06T00:04:32+0000

Have you ever tried alternatives to smoking that would help in these situations? How did it go? | 2015-08-06T00:08:38+0000
10435 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | Have you ever noticed a connection between smoking and your mood? Is there an emotional state that gets you to light up more frequently? #TDII | 3 | I tried to step in the back, just breath for a few mins, grab a drink, but then I'd get  told to get back to work by an angry manager,  which would just piss me off more,  so then I'd go outside for a smoke. I think that's one of the honest reasons I started, because it seems like smokers get way more breaks because of their habit. | 2015-08-06T00:16:28+0000

10435 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | Have you ever noticed a connection between smoking and your mood?

I've considered vaping, but I feel that some of the Facebook posts on here saying they are just as bad as regular cigarettes, and shouldn't be used as a crutch to help you quit. | 2015-08-06T00:21:54+0000

Have you ever thought about nicotine replacement at all? | 2015-08-06T00:27:39+0000

Just like McDonald's targeting kids with happy meals and play places to get them hooked on fast food for life, which is also insanely unhealthy. It's nothing new to me that I'm part of a demographic that is targeted by people making money. I don't have any feelings on it, because at the end of the day they're all out to make as much money as possible and it's a hell of a better idea for them to try and hook a 15-20 year old with 60 years left in them than a 60 year old with not much life left. | 2015-08-03T21:35:59+0000

Comprehension is the key to overcoming addiction, most don't see that. You must know what you're doing in order for you to stop doing it.

My doctor said that my spine is like a 35-year-old's spine (I'm 25) and said that smoking is probably the main reason for that. It definitely put it in my head that smoking is not helping me any and is aging me faster and probably cutting a chunk of life off me, so I would say yes. The more I think about it, the more I realize I should quit to save my life. And hearing it from a doc definitely puts it into perspective. | 2015-08-01T19:32:32+0000

100005594500096 | Tsp Study | TSP other post | Tsp Study  | #1 - #7 are week 1, posts #8 - #14 are week 2, etc.Thanks Victoria from TSP |  | Hi everyone!First of all, thanks to everyone who has been commenting on the posts. We really appreciate your input, no matter what it is. Thank you for being so active!On the note of incentives, I want to make sure everything is clear. This group has weekly incentives, which means that you have to comment every single day of that week in order to get $7 for that week. You can either get $0 or $7 per week, there are NO in betweens!If the Tsp Study page has liked a post already, that means I have already checked that post for your comments and you can no longer comment on it to count for incentives!Some of you have gotten 6 out of 7 days of a week and are NOT going to be paid for that week because you didn't get all 7. I just wanted to be clear on that so no one is confused! The weeks go by every 7 posts: post #1 - #7 are week 1, posts #8 - #14 are week 2, etc.Thanks Victoria from TSP | 0 | n/a | 2015-07-31T19:54:45+0000

10408 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | Have you ever tried to quit or reduce your smoking? Which strategy did you choose and how did it go? #TDII | 1 | I just chose cutting back. smoking half a cigarette instead of a full one so that I reduced consumption. It went alright. But still a bad habit | 2015-07-30T00:04:00+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment | 10408  | #TDII |  | Have you ever tried to quit or reduce your smoking? Which strategy did you choose and how did it go? #TDII | 2 | Hi 10408 - and would you recommend it to someone who is trying to quit? What in your experience is crucial to making it work? | 2015-07-30T00:06:41+0000
10408 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | Have you ever tried to quit or reduce your smoking? Which strategy did you choose and how did it go? #TDII | 3 | Yes cutting back is a good strategy. But you still have the same cravings. I think nicotine replacement would be better for me. Instead of still smoking cigarettes | 2015-07-30T00:07:44+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment | 10408  | #TDII |  | Have you ever tried to quit or reduce your smoking? Which strategy did you choose and how did it go? #TDII | 4 | Yeah 10408 - nicotine replacement can be quite effective to reduce those cravings. Have you given any more thought to which strategy or product you would like to use in a future quit attempt? | 2015-07-30T00:10:36+0000
10408 | Participant | TDII response comment | Johannes Thrul  | #TDII |  | Have you ever tried to quit or reduce your smoking? Which strategy did you choose and how did it go? #TDII | 5 | I have. I think the gum would work best for me. any particular brand that you recommend? Johannes Thrul | 2015-07-30T00:11:39+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | Have you ever tried to quit or reduce your smoking? Which strategy did you choose and how did it go? #TDII | 6 | No not really - you can just choose one in your local pharmacy. Just make sure to follow these instructions when you use it - many people chew it like a normal gum and don't like the results: Chew nicotine gum slowly until you can taste the nicotine or feel a slight tingling in your mouth. Then stop chewing and place (park) the chewing gum between your cheek and gum. When the tingling is almost gone (about 1 minute), start chewing again; repeat this procedure for about 30 minutes. How many cigarettes do you smoke on an average day? | 2015-07-30T00:15:08+0000
10408 | Participant | TDII response comment | Johannes Thrul  | #TDII |  | Have you ever tried to quit or reduce your smoking? Which strategy did you choose and how did it go? #TDII | 7 | Johannes Thrul I'd say 10-15 | 2015-07-30T00:44:35+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | Have you ever tried to quit or reduce your smoking? Which strategy did you choose and how did it go? #TDII | 8 | So you could either start with the 4mg or the 2mg gum. Do you usually smoke within the first 30 mins after waking? That may be an indicator for using the stronger one. Also, which state do you live in? There may be options to get free nicotine replacement from the smokers quitline. | 2015-07-30T00:52:44+0000

I've got to run but I'll see you next week! | 2015-07-30T01:10:25+0000

Why might it be hard for you to quit? #beingconscious | 4 | We are all human and we all have different ways to cope with the daily stresses of life. Once a habit is once that alleviates these stresses, it's like taking a dance with the devil. Once a person quits smoking, its going to be a daily taunt for a whole, our conscience is going to let it be clear that there are others in the world that can still smoke and lead a fulfilling life. We are going to want to pick up a cigarette again, that's just the bottom line. | 2015-07-29T19:41:36+0000

Share your plan of action and see if any other group members are on the same page! #beingconscious | 7 | I think I'm going to cold turkey my addiction because it would take the most willpower and probably lead me to stop smoking for good. | 2015-07-28T01:52:36+0000

Post and share your experiences. #reflection | 6 | My grandfather died from lung cancer, which is a total oxymoron, given the fact that I struggle with smoking myself. It kind of scares me actually to think that addiction runs in my family. I don't want to be the end of the cycle, or even part of the cycle and let my addiction get the best of me. | 2015-07-26T04:39:27+0000

10450 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What is currently your biggest smoking trigger? #TDII | 3 | Specifically when I'm working. Boredom (and with it, the urge to smoke) strikes when I'm sitting at my desk doing paperwork or scanning charts. | 2015-07-23T01:09:52+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment | 10450  | #TDII |  | What is currently your biggest smoking trigger? #TDII | 4 | 10450, have you ever experimented with alternatives other than smoking that help you deal with boredom? If so how did it go? | 2015-07-23T01:13:04+0000
10327 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What is currently your biggest smoking trigger? #TDII | 5 | Stress. When shit hits the fan, I want a cigarette the most. | 2015-07-23T01:27:51+0000

I'm curious - have you ever experimented with alternatives other than smoking to deal with the cravings? | 2015-07-23T01:30:55+0000
10327 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What is currently your biggest smoking trigger? #TDII | 8 | Chewing gum but that gets boring and doesn't give me the "calming" effects that I thought nicotine did for me. | 2015-07-23T01:32:37+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment | 10327  | #TDII |  | What is currently your biggest smoking trigger? #TDII | 9 | That's understandable 10327 - you may want to try the nicotine gum sometime, which has the added advantage that it would provide this additional effect. | 2015-07-23T01:36:36+0000
10408 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What is currently your biggest smoking trigger? #TDII | 10 | Hi Doc, I tried e-cigs for about a week and didn't enjoy the harshness on my throat. I've wanted to try the patch or gum but haven't done it yet. | 2015-07-23T01:37:33+0000
10450 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What is currently your biggest smoking trigger? #TDII | 11 | I've tried doing pushups (or exercise in general), which can help, but is not always feasible at work... | 2015-07-23T01:37:52+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment | 10408  | #TDII |  | What is currently your biggest smoking trigger? #TDII | 12 | Hi 10408 - I would definitely recommend nicotine replacement as these medications can really increase your chances of quitting successfully and help deal with cravings. If you want to find out about your options check out these resources: http://smokefree.gov/explore-medications | 2015-07-23T01:39:44+0000
10327 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What is currently your biggest smoking trigger? #TDII | 13 | The nicotine gum still doesn't give me the full effect of smoking a cigarette. Maybe it is the oral fixation with the cigarettes themselves and seeing the fact that I can make smoke, if that makes any sense at all. I have an e-cigarette and that helps , but the craving a for a real cigarette is still there. | 2015-07-23T01:40:03+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What is currently your biggest smoking trigger? #TDII | 14 | Sorry guys, I have to run. Great discussion today - see you next week! | 2015-07-23T01:43:19+0000

I didn't know I could cough more if I stopped smoking.  That's a relief for me to hear | 2015-07-22T19:05:43+0000

I feel as though exercise is not a priority for me, given my health condition and the fact that I have never had trouble losing weight, it happens quite easily.

To have you remain a loyal customer? To help you quit smoking? Other ideas? #ecig | 1 | Purely money making.  Some think tank probably stole the idea from a small business  startup and started pushing the advertisements and products. Of course the young are in mind because they are more attractive than cigarettes. But they certainly don't want you to stop, that cuts into their profit margins. | 2015-07-17T19:07:57+0000

Other ideas? #ecig | 2 | I think the big tobacco companies secretly feel threatened by e-cig companies, which moved them to create a link between the two, so that the big tobacco companies that have been around forever will not feel pressured by this new market. I also think big tobacco companies want to save as many customers as possible from totally cutting ties to them, which is far from helping us quit smoking. Big tobacco companies want us to keep smoking. | 2015-07-17T20:35:37+0000

So you spend $30 on a vaper or ecig, you can practice smoke tricks, show off to your friends, and go home without smelling like smoke. I know for a fact there's a senior at my little sisters highschool that will buy them for younger students. (It's been reported), but I don't believe they should be used by the younger crowd because it still supports an addiction. When I tried an ecig, I missed the burn of a regular cig, so  I switched back within a month. | 2015-07-16T19:18:54+0000

If I were a minor, I think an e-cig would definitely be more appealing and "safer" to try than an e-cigarette. Thinking about all of the toxins that are in a regular cigarette; an e-cigarette would almost be the utmost healthy alternative to smoking cigarettes. As a minor, I wouldn't have to mind the factors of actually smoking a real cigarette, such as physical health risks, as well as social risks. If I were a minor and an e-cigarette were available to try, I would definitely try one and I probably wouldn't still be trying to wean myself off of cigarettes to this day. The controversy between the FDA and other big wigs about e-cigarettes, I think is preposterous, I feel as though it is just a ploy between the FDA and the federal government  to maximize the tobacco taxes that already already apparent throughout the United States. In other words, the federal government wants more money and tobacco is the easiest target to regulate. | 2015-07-17T12:39:03+0000

Did any of the information surprise you? #smokingaffectsall | 6 | According to the Missouri Department of Health, "Smoking is the most preventable cause of disease, disability and death in Missouri." This information surprised me, given the fact that I feel as though other health risks that involve something as simple as changing your diet would be more preventable than smoking. I would think that eating a deli sandwich instead of a greasy cheeseburger would be more of a common way to prevent disease, at least, instead of smoking. Also, I know that, in almost any business establishment, other than some bars and grills in Missouri, smoking is not allowed, even e-cigarettes. This ban was placed within the span of ten years, I believe, which I think is ridiculous, especially e-cigarettes, which aren't even harmful to the environment. | 2015-07-15T00:57:39+0000

Every time I went to light up, I had to write down the time and why I was smoking (habit, stress, or reward). It helped me realize what triggered me to smoke most and then come up with plan for fixing, avoiding, or overcoming those triggers. | 2015-07-13T19:09:14+0000

Becoming independent worked because I told myself to never give up, and even though I hit roadblocks in the process, I still succeeded. I become fully independent at the age of 20, but I've been on my own since I was 17. My support groups have diminished and replenished, so to speak, so I guess I would have to say I helped myself get through the obstacles that were in my way. | 2015-07-13T22:14:25+0000

I  seem to be working during your sessions | 4 | Thanks for your question 10435 - you know it is very much likely that the toxins in cigarette smoke could have something to do with that. However, I am a psychologist and not a medical doctor and no doctor will be able to give you a good answer without actually seeing you. I highly recommend you see your primary health care provider and get it checked out to be certain! Let me know if there is anything else I can help you with! | 2015-07-22T23:45:17+0000
