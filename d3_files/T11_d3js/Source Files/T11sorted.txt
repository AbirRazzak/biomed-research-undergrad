It will never go away, EVER. And that's a fact and that fact is also the norm, and people should deal with it and not be a bitch about it, within reason.

10427 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What is currently your biggest smoking trigger? #TDII | 5 | Right now its been 3 days since I last smoked one.

Also not buying a new pack is a great strategy! Last week we talked about strategies for dealing with high-risk situations and how to decline a cigarette offer. Have you had any of these situations in the past week? How did they go? | 2015-10-08T00:49:51+0000

1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What is currently your biggest smoking trigger? #TDII | 9 | Before I take off for today, I briefly wanted to talk about the topic of lapse/relapse (not that I think it will happen in your case, but I am a firm believer that it is better to be prepared). Remember that even if you smoke another cigarette, it is always up to you how you continue after that. Smoking on cigarette doesn't make you a smoker again and doesn't mean you have to go back to your old smoking pattern. | 2015-10-08T01:02:42+0000

Remind yourself of the hard work youâ€™ve done towards quitting and choose not to smoke the next cigarette! But please do not interpret this as â€œpermissionâ€? to have a slip. Remember, the surest way to quit smoking is to not smoke the 1st cigarette! | 2015-10-08T01:03:40+0000

What would you say about your companyâ€™s mission? What would you tell the kids about smoking? #knowyourself | 2 | Who would do that?  Smoking is an strictly adult privilege. I cant imagine any business man or woman in the tobbaco, alcohol, or any drug business even considering discussing their work with children.  Smoking is an individual's decision to be made as an adult. | 2015-09-22T00:31:27+0000

Certainly I choose to smoke around certain people but this isn't to hide the fact that I do. So in short I guess my answer is no. | 2015-08-29T19:24:30+0000

They sure can destiny's between a cigarette and a vape pen and even a joint or blunt or cigar. Should we smoke in front of them?  I don't know, but if we do, we should absolutely quit in front of them too. | 2015-08-29T21:21:40+0000

10472 | Participant | TSP daily post response comment |  | #beingconscious | 38 | #38: What have you heard about the patch, a form of Nicotine Replacement Therapy? Would you ever use it? #beingconscious | 1 | With an average success rate of 7%, its not the best thing out there. I think it is due to it only containing nicotine and none of the MAOIs in tobacco that we crave in combination with nicotine. | 2015-08-28T19:04:19+0000

10472 | Participant | TSP daily post response comment |  | #beingconscious | 38 | #38: What have you heard about the patch, a form of Nicotine Replacement Therapy? Would you ever use it? #beingconscious | 5 | And I truly think its low success rate because it is missing those other nicotine-related compounds and beta-carboline MAOIs that we all crave in combination with nicotine. Tobacco is essentially a drug trifecta, designed by evolution to be extra addictive to the humans that it co-evolved with. | 2015-08-28T19:18:15+0000
10472 | Participant | TSP daily post response comment |  | #beingconscious | 38 | #38: What have you heard about the patch, a form of Nicotine Replacement Therapy? Would you ever use it? #beingconscious | 6 | People, pharmacologists, pharmacists, doctors, and researchers need to stop thinking its only nicotine that we crave. That's incredibly ignorant to assume. | 2015-08-28T19:21:13+0000
10499 | Participant | TSP daily post response comment |  | #beingconscious | 38 | #38: What have you heard about the patch, a form of Nicotine Replacement Therapy? Would you ever use it? #beingconscious | 7 | Tried  it.  Didn't do it for me | 2015-08-28T19:52:15+0000

10427 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | Today, I wanted to ask you about smoking and alcohol use. Is there a connection between the two in your personal experience? #TDII | 1 | Oh definitely. I don't have to drink and smoke but when I do I can easily burn through more than one pack | 2015-08-20T00:03:15+0000
10471 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | Today, I wanted to ask you about smoking and alcohol use. Is there a connection between the two in your personal experience? #TDII | 2 | Yes, it is very hard for me not to smoke when I am drinking. When I drink I smoke cigarettes one after another. | 2015-08-20T00:05:55+0000
10427 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | Today, I wanted to ask you about smoking and alcohol use. Is there a connection between the two in your personal experience? #TDII | 3 | It's easy for me to not smoke and drink when no one else around me isn't and I don't have one. But as soon as I smell burning tobacco with alcohol in my system is when the urge to smoke is at it's worst | 2015-08-20T00:10:20+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment | 10427 10471  | #TDII |  | Today, I wanted to ask you about smoking and alcohol use. Is there a connection between the two in your personal experience? #TDII | 4 | Thanks for sharing guys! I agree - the combination of alcohol and smoking makes it really hard to abstain for many people. What do you think are the reasons the two go together so well 10427 10471? | 2015-08-20T00:12:49+0000
10471 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | Today, I wanted to ask you about smoking and alcohol use. Is there a connection between the two in your personal experience? #TDII | 5 | I'm honestly not sure, a chemical reaction possibly? | 2015-08-20T00:13:44+0000
10427 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | Today, I wanted to ask you about smoking and alcohol use. Is there a connection between the two in your personal experience? #TDII | 6 | For me it's the distinct feeling of inhaling the cigarette. Getting the nicotine rush. When I'm drunk that feeling is multiplied almost. It's more enjoyable than when I'm sober. Why that is exactly I'm not sure | 2015-08-20T00:15:24+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment | 10427 10471  | #TDII |  | Today, I wanted to ask you about smoking and alcohol use. Is there a connection between the two in your personal experience? #TDII | 7 | Great suggestions guys - and you are both right, there is a chemical interaction between the two that makes the use more appealing. The social situations most likely has to do with it as well with other smokers around etc. So if you ever wanted to smoke less in these kinds of situations what could you do? What are your options 10471 10427? | 2015-08-20T00:21:38+0000
10427 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | Today, I wanted to ask you about smoking and alcohol use. Is there a connection between the two in your personal experience? #TDII | 8 | Not buy a pack before drinking and try to stay away from other who are drinking as well. Chewing gum or sunflower seeds work really well for me whenever I don't want to smoke in any situation. | 2015-08-20T00:23:09+0000
10471 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | Today, I wanted to ask you about smoking and alcohol use. Is there a connection between the two in your personal experience? #TDII | 9 | Well I always kind of assumed I would have to stay away from drinking and other people who smoke for a little while once I quit. | 2015-08-20T00:23:22+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment | 10427 10471  | #TDII |  | Today, I wanted to ask you about smoking and alcohol use. Is there a connection between the two in your personal experience? #TDII | 10 | Both of these are good options. Given that alcohol is a big risk factor for smoking it may make sense to not go out to drink, at least initially after you have quit 10471. In the long run, it is also a good idea to come up with alternatives, just like you suggested 10427. Other ideas for alternatives include Keep your hands busy: Use a stress ball, play a game on your phone, play with a Rubikâ€™s cube, start a fun arts and crafts project. Keep your mouth busy: Use gum, hard candy, mints, chew on toothpicks, prepare healthy snacks like veggie sticks, drink plenty of water Any of these sound useful to you guys? | 2015-08-20T00:27:41+0000
10471 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | Today, I wanted to ask you about smoking and alcohol use. Is there a connection between the two in your personal experience? #TDII | 11 | I tried chewing sunflower seeds to keep my mouth busy, but it didn't really help much last time I quit. I will have to try keeping my hands busy as well next time. | 2015-08-20T00:29:04+0000
10427 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | Today, I wanted to ask you about smoking and alcohol use. Is there a connection between the two in your personal experience? #TDII | 12 | Very useful. I always carry sunflower seeds on me as I'm attempting to quit now by weening myself off them. The salt seems to help but I've never tried to use that while drinking as well since the opportunity has yet to come around | 2015-08-20T00:29:39+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment | 10427 10471  | #TDII |  | Today, I wanted to ask you about smoking and alcohol use. Is there a connection between the two in your personal experience? #TDII | 13 | Great - one more thing that may be useful is to ask your fellow smokers not to smoke around you and not to offer cigarettes. Most smokers are usually quite happy to help others quit. At the very least worth a try :) So how do you guys think about quitting at the moment? Are you considering to give it a try at all 10471 10427? | 2015-08-20T00:32:29+0000
10471 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | Today, I wanted to ask you about smoking and alcohol use. Is there a connection between the two in your personal experience? #TDII | 14 | I want to quit sooner than later, I might stop smoking soon | 2015-08-20T00:33:22+0000
10427 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | Today, I wanted to ask you about smoking and alcohol use. Is there a connection between the two in your personal experience? #TDII | 15 | I definitely am. Currently I'm down to 2 maybe 3 a day as I'm working so much and my coworkers who smoke help remind me to limit my intake. Same with my friends. It's getting easier each day to resist the urge but some days do prove more taxing than others | 2015-08-20T00:34:03+0000

What are your high risk situations and what can you do to not smoke when you have an urge in these situations? | 2015-08-20T00:38:05+0000
10427 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | Today, I wanted to ask you about smoking and alcohol use. Is there a connection between the two in your personal experience? #TDII | 18 | Driving, being around smokers, being drunk, and when I'm stressed. In each situation there's definitely other things I could do to occupy myself. I just have to remind myself each time to stick to it and in the long run it's definitely worth it. | 2015-08-20T00:40:23+0000

Is there a connection between the two in your personal experience? #TDII | 23 | Hi 10418 - so if you wanted to smoke less in these situations how would you go about it? What could work for you? | 2015-08-20T00:54:11+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | Today, I wanted to ask you about smoking and alcohol use. Is there a connection between the two in your personal experience? #TDII | 24 | Great discussion today guys - I'm about to take off for today, but wanted to give you some more information on what I consider the most important steps towards quitting for good. There are several aspects to it: 1. I would recommend to pick a quit day and following through with it. 2. Get support from family/friends/colleagues. 3. Learn new skills and alternative behaviors for your high risk situations. 4. Depending on how much you smoke, I would definitely recommend that you consider trying some form of nicotine replacement therapy â€“ we know that using these can dramatically decrease your cravings and withdrawal and increase your chances to quit for good. 5. Be prepared for relapse or difficult situations (e.g., alcohol, being around other smokers, stress, etc.). I know this sounds like a lot, but we will cover each of these aspects more in depth over the next weeks. How does this sound? Anything there you think may be useful? | 2015-08-20T00:59:01+0000
10418 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | Today, I wanted to ask you about smoking and alcohol use. Is there a connection between the two in your personal experience? #TDII | 25 | I think simply not supplying myself with cigarettes is the only option.  I lack enough willpower when under the influence to practice self control. | 2015-08-20T00:59:31+0000

While tobacco companies have a bad name because they serve a potentially deadly product, they are a business looking to stay afloat and make money.  It's a business and as bad as it may be its doing a good job. | 2015-08-12T23:05:59+0000

Had there been flavors I would have started smokingvatvthe same time. But I would have smoked way more than what I first did. | 2015-08-11T19:03:18+0000

Would you have started smoking at an earlier age if the product you used was flavored like your favorite candy? #ecig | 2 | No I was warned about how bad cigarettes were from a young age and stayed away from them.  I tried marijuana first because it was less opposed by my family and moreso hidden.  Then when I tried it and found it to be harmless I tried other things starting with cigarettes.  I've been smoking full flavor pall malls since I was 16-17.  Even when the flavored e cigs came out I stuck to the ones that resembled cigarettes or cigars flavor wise. | 2015-08-11T19:08:42+0000

Certainly it would have been more appealing though. These days however I find flavored smoke, or ecig smoke period, to only be appealing once in a while | 2015-08-11T20:35:31+0000

I smoke a pack and then some everyday, so I'm going to start at 16 a day and cut down by 2 every week.

It was helping a lot at first but now I find myself picking up a cigarette more often than a vape | 2015-08-01T19:22:54+0000

Have/would you ever try one? #ecig | 6 | The placebo effect works great for some people, so if others are able to substitute e cigs for cigarettes, then awesome for them. For me, smoking seems to be something I do out of boredom or stress, and I pick up a cigarette purely out of habit. If I learned better ways of coping and keep my hands occupied, quitting would become exponentially easier. The patches irritate my skin and I don't like chewing gum, but I have tried Chantix before with great results. Unfortunately, I have terrible anxiety and Chantix completely intensified it, so I had to stop taking it. But otherwise, it's the most effective thing I've found | 2015-08-04T01:13:08+0000

Kids are going to smoke cigarettes regardless of any law put in place. But if we can provide them with something safer, then by all means, that's what we should be doing. If ecigs were widely popular when I was a kid, I would have much rather taken that route and maybe I wouldn't be a cigarette smoker today.

Personally I think neither is safe but you probably should move to vaping to quit smoking, my sister uses hers quite a bit and its cut her smoking habits down.

To have you remain a loyal customer? To help you quit smoking? Other ideas? #ecig | 4 | Also, did you know that nicotine alone is not addictive? That's right folks, you heard it here first. Nicotine is only extremely addictive when an MAOI (like those found in tobacco) is coadministered. That's why many smokers who switch to vamping feel 'something is missing'. Look it up. So no, they're not trying to lure anyone into addiction, it is truthfully a safer way to get your nicotine. | 2015-07-26T19:27:49+0000

They saw opportunity in e cigs with most of America trying to live a healthier lifestyle. That's the ONLY reason they've made a healthier product. Not to mention it makes an even easier target to people who otherwise wouldn't have ever smoked | 2015-07-26T19:31:32+0000

I quit smoking for about 8 months when I first joined, but that was because I wasn't allowed to smoke in basic training or during my job training. Now I smoke about a pack a day, and I am trying to cut back by vaping. I joined this group because I am trying to quit eventually, so why not get some advice and make a few dollars in the process! | 2015-07-22T22:28:16+0000

I live with my husband and my nine month old daughter, since I have had her I've wanted my husband and I to quit smoking for good. My smoking habits decreased for about a month and eventually I'd stopped for about two days. Soon after I started back, with that said I'd really like a little guidance in quitting for good and remaining that way the money part is just sweetening the deal. | 2015-07-22T23:32:54+0000

My first cigarette was at the tender age of 13. My gums look awful, I smell awful, my bank account is dwindling away to big tobacco companies. The ONLY reason I smoke is simply out of mindless habit. I don't even enjoy it. Ugh | 2015-07-23T04:29:57+0000

But I also go through stages where I don't smoke at all. I quit smoking all the time. My friends all smoke and I love smoking. But I know Its bad and that I have to quit before I get much older. | 2015-07-23T15:52:44+0000

I smoke, on average, a pack every other day or so only because I've begun to ween myself off. I've attempted quitting 4 times in the past year and it hasn't quite worked yet but I'm getting there! What I hope to gain from this is some motivation from like-minded individuals. Looking forward to getting to know you all better and helping each other in whatever ways we can. | 2015-07-25T08:04:32+0000

It was such a feeling of accomplishment to realize I, at the time 18 years old, traveled over 10,000 miles and to 6 different countries. My grandmother funded this backpacking trip for me and I was able to talk to friends and family back home easily. I feel it worked out because of my determination and love of travel. | 2015-07-22T19:11:33+0000

The looks on my parents faces were priceless, I don't think I will ever forget how proud they were that day. All in all just a great feeling and a great day! | 2015-07-22T22:30:52+0000

Who helped? #motivation | 3 | The day I birthed my daughter hearing her first cries after nine hot agonizing months was the most amazing thing I've ever heard. Being a young mother is hard 21, juggling a full time job and running your normal life but all the more rewarding at the end of the day. | 2015-07-22T22:48:45+0000

Who helped? #motivation | 4 | I just got a perfect score on my biology exam because I studied before hand. What helped was getting fustrated with non perfect scores in the past and being hard on myself knowing I could do better. | 2015-07-22T23:04:57+0000

Who helped? #motivation | 5 | I think my biggest success was simply finally accepting things as they come and realizing that I can't change things. For so long I freaked and obsessed over things out of my control and now I've learned to calm down and not let things get to me as much. | 2015-07-23T00:14:26+0000
10427 | Participant | TSP daily post response comment |  | #motivation | 1 | #1: Share a success that youâ€™ve had in the past. It can be anything from any time. Why did it work? Who helped? #motivation | 6 | I would have to say that personally my biggest success was realizing my biggest problem in life was myself. In which I mean that all that was going wrong was merely due to my own actions and mindset. My father was a big roll in this but my older brother who I love dearly was the main source as I made the realization that his struggles were his own doings, it dawned on me that I was on the same path as him. It's not that we live terrible lives or anything like that. We just created most, if not all, of our troubles on our own. Once I made the mindset that I can have major influence on my entire existence and nothing else does, to plan for the future but still live for the day, it was hard to not succeed. | 2015-07-23T03:56:18+0000

I took a chance going for something I never thought I'd get and surprised myself with my interview abilities and adaption skills. | 2015-07-23T04:24:42+0000
