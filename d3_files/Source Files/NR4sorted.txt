If you are in recovery you have experienced what it is like to change something major in your life and quitting smoking eventually will be similar - tough but possible.

Just have to apply them and see where it takes me. My fiancee and I did try a gradual reduction but keeping count became tedious and she was on it more than I was it seemed. I began to feel pressured which frustrated me more. | 2015-06-11T03:42:51+0000

It can be hard to quit with your partner, but it seems you have a good motivator in your son as well. Imagery is definitely helpful. Exercise may be particularly useful to you, especially if you are working out at the level of a boxer. Do you have a routine that is ideal for you now or do you think you might want to change it up to help you to feel more relaxed after workouts? | 2015-06-11T03:45:39+0000

I'd love to reestablish a routine. We have a nice little gym and pool in our apartment complex. I guess it's just mustering up the motivation.

I don't mean to stress you out by mentioning, but if workouts help you to let off steam, they will be able to support you when you decide to quit and also help to motivate you because you will feel the need to breathe differently than if you are not working out. | 2015-06-11T03:52:33+0000

That being said I honestly couldn't tell you which celebrities do, have or don't smoke. I personally don't pay that much attention and don't know anyone who does. | 2015-06-07T19:08:05+0000

What do you think about tobacco companies targeting young people through the media? #beingconscious | 6 | Thanks for sharing your view! | 2015-06-03T18:35:20+0000

That really sucked for someone who has bad hips :/ honestly, that's more of an inconvenience really...

Usually just the pack and how good tasting they are or how high quality the tobacco is. Old ads, however, like Joe Cool the camel, portrayed a "too cool for school" type of character whose fortÃ© happens to be looking slick and smoking stogies. | 2015-05-25T16:30:52+0000

1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment | 10147  | #TDII |  | What do you guys like about smoking? #TDII | 4 | Wow that's quite a few cons there. How are those smoking reduction techniques we talked about last week working out for you 10147? | 2015-05-14T00:19:48+0000
10147 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What do you guys like about smoking? #TDII | 5 | Trying real hard, Johannes. I've gotten up to 20 minutes after I wake to wait and smoke and still at about 10 after my meals. I'm trying to slowly reduce how many cigarettes I smoke a day, but that doesn't seem to work too well because I lose track of how many I've smoked. My fiancee is keeping on me about it, though. Lol | 2015-05-14T00:22:46+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What do you guys like about smoking? #TDII | 6 | Have you tried tallying your cigs somewhere? Like in a notebook, on your phone, or something like that? That may help you keep track. Also I want to share something with you that you may find useful: We call it the mood log. You can tally the number of cigs you smoke each day, and note your mood and the number of pleasant activities. This might help you keeping track and also learning something about how your smoking is related to your mood etc. Do you think this may be useful? Do you want to give it a try? | 2015-05-14T00:28:51+0000
10147 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What do you guys like about smoking? #TDII | 7 | I'd love to try it. | 2015-05-14T00:31:49+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment | 10147  | #TDII |  | What do you guys like about smoking? #TDII | 8 | Great 10147 - I know all of this is not easy and I really appreciate your effort! You know I think the most important part is that you are willing to try. Have you given any though to using nicotine replacement at all? That may actually help reduce your cravings and urges and help reducing your cigs. Just something you may want to think about, but totally up to you obviously. Let me know if you'd like to discuss more. | 2015-05-14T00:35:31+0000

10147 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | Do you think you will EVER be ready to quit smoking? Why? Why not? #TDII | 1 | Yes! :D and I'm working on it. My fiancee suggested I count how many cigarettes I smoke starting today then tomorrow I smoke one less. For the next three days I'll continue with that then smoke one less. And so forth until I'm done. Hopefully it works. | 2015-05-07T00:20:15+0000
10138 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | Do you think you will EVER be ready to quit smoking? Why? Why not? #TDII | 2 | Yes I'm goin to start trying at least because I'm only 22 and my chest hurts when I lay down at night and when I get up in the morning until I get my first cig | 2015-05-07T00:20:32+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | Do you think you will EVER be ready to quit smoking? Why? Why not? #TDII | 3 | Very cool guys - it's great to hear that you are thinking about cutting back on your smoking. There are several recommendation I have for you: Gradually reduce the number of cigarettes you smoke of your current brand. Some things you could try there: Pick certain cigarettes you want to eliminate (e.g. the first or last one each day, a cigarette after a meal), you could also think about declaring smoke free zones to get you to smoke less (e.g. stop smoking in your car). Yet another way would be to gradually increase the time interval between cigarettes. Any of these sound like they may work for you? | 2015-05-07T00:25:42+0000
10147 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | Do you think you will EVER be ready to quit smoking? Why? Why not? #TDII | 4 | Yes I think I'm going to gradually reduce how many I smoke. I think the hardest to give up would be the after meal and waking ones. | 2015-05-07T00:33:53+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment | 10147  | #TDII |  | Do you think you will EVER be ready to quit smoking? Why? Why not? #TDII | 5 | Yeah, these are difficult for a lot of people I work with. Maybe you can try to extent the time interval before you smoke after a meal or in the morning first? How about waiting for 10 minutes and gradually increasing? You could also brush your teeth first thing after waking or eating, that may make smoking less appealing for a while? Do you have any ideas? Or anyone else in the group? What would you recommend for 10147? | 2015-05-07T00:37:19+0000
10147 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | Do you think you will EVER be ready to quit smoking? Why? Why not? #TDII | 6 | I like the extending time idea a lot. | 2015-05-07T00:46:46+0000

Do you want to try quitting for good or does smoking reduction sound like something you would want to try first? | 2015-05-07T00:46:51+0000

Give it a try and let me know how it goes! You will learn a lot about coping with your triggers and cravings in the process, I am sure :) | 2015-05-07T00:48:13+0000
10138 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | Do you think you will EVER be ready to quit smoking? Why? Why not? #TDII | 9 | I want to quit for good I'm tired of it | 2015-05-07T00:53:20+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | Do you think you will EVER be ready to quit smoking? Why? Why not? #TDII | 10 | Ok, in this case I want to share with you a list of things that I think are crucial when you quit smoking: 1. I would recommend to pick a quit day and following through with it. 2. Get support from family/friends/colleagues. 3. Learn new skills and alternative behaviors for your high risk situations. 4. Depending on how much you smoke I would definitely recommend that you consider trying some form of nicotine replacement therapy â€“ we know that using these can dramatically decrease your cravings and withdrawal and increase your chances to quit for good. 5. Be prepared for relapse or difficult situations (e.g., alcohol, being around other smokers, stress, etc.). I know this sounds like a lot, but I would be happy to talk to you more in detail about each step. How do these sound? Anything that may be useful for you? | 2015-05-07T00:58:03+0000

Does that change how you feel about smoking and quitting? #TDII | 4 | Ok - so the bottom line is that it's really hard to make generalizations based on a couple of examples. Of course there are some people who are still healthy despite smoking (though you don't know if they wouldn't be even healthier if they never smoked), but on the other hand there are also others how have health problems. In research we usually look at large numbers of people to estimate the average effect - check out this study for example: http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa1211128 What do you think about this? | 2015-04-30T00:34:40+0000

But unfortunately as much as I enjoy those things, I don't see them holding my interest as a relaxation method long because it isn't instantly gratifying.

What do they think about your smoking? #TDII | 18 | No worries 10147. Some options you could try: Listening to your favorite music really concentrating on the experience and enjoying it. Playing a game on your phone to distract you. Exercising and enjoying the feeling of accomplishment and relaxation. Spending time or playing with your son. Taking ten deep breaths counting from ten to one and paying attention to your body becoming more relaxed with every breath. Just some ideas. Anything sound like it may work for you?

Where cigarettes have smoke, tar and chemicals, e-cigs have their vapors, chemicals and possibility of mold inhalation in one's that aren't properly maintained.

10165 | Participant | TSP other post response comment |  | #balance |  | Tell us how your life would be different if your first impression was never smoky? #balance | 5 | Never. I don't need to smoke so if I go somewhere for a first impression, the smokey treats stay at home. Plus in my house we smoke outside so our clothes don't smell like smoke as bad. Combine those two with mint gum and a spritz of perfume and no one ever knows I smoked. My last job didn't hire smokers so I never smoked at work or brought them with me or anything. | 2015-03-28T19:26:22+0000

Smoking only inhibits me when I have to stop doing what I'm doing to smoke a cigarette or when it puts me in a bad mood because I don't have one. When it effects my mood it also effects the people I'm with because I tend to be an ass. | 2015-03-15T00:29:37+0000

So I got my GED, attended CNA classes and got a full time job. I was able to keep the house up and things went smoothly. And because my parents didn't have the stress of the bills, both were able to relax and get better. So I guess that's my only success story. | 2015-03-13T22:22:36+0000
