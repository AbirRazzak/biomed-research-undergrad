100005594500096 | Tsp Study | TSP other post |  | #e-cig |  | Everyone wants to know whether electronic cigarettes can help smokers quit. Unfortunately studies are showing that they are not any more effective than a placebo. So health professionals still recommend using well-studied strategies like counseling or nicotine replacement therapy (patch, gum) when youâ€™re ready to quit. #e-cig | 0 | n/a | 2015-04-01T19:00:42+0000

10113 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | Today, I wanted to ask you about smoking and alcohol use. Is there a connection between the two in your personal experience? #TDII | 5 | Maybe about half a pack a day. At most. And yes I'd like to cut that in half. The cigs I smoke take a little longer to smoke than a typical cigarette, so I've started just smoking half of them and saving the other half for next time | 2015-02-25T19:57:01+0000

Is there a connection between the two in your personal experience? #TDII | 6 | So you are smoking up to 10 a day and want to get it down to around 5? One strategy you have already started using is to smoke the cigarettes only half and saving the rest for later. Have you already tried other strategies? Do you have any ideas what may work for you? | 2015-02-25T20:00:09+0000
10113 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | Today, I wanted to ask you about smoking and alcohol use. Is there a connection between the two in your personal experience? #TDII | 7 | Yes that's correct. I had a vaporizer pen that uses nicotine juice for a while, but I need to get a new battery for it. Also just refusing to by a box when I can | 2015-02-25T20:07:33+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | Today, I wanted to ask you about smoking and alcohol use. Is there a connection between the two in your personal experience? #TDII | 8 | Ok, you are using a vapor pen to give you the nicotine intermittently and you are also limiting the availability of cigarettes by simply not buying a pack every so often. Do you ever have strong cravings when you voluntarily decide not to smoke and if yes how do you deal with them? | 2015-02-25T20:13:22+0000
10113 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | Today, I wanted to ask you about smoking and alcohol use. Is there a connection between the two in your personal experience? #TDII | 9 | Eh, they come and go. If I decide not to smoke and don't have my vapor pen, definitely strong cravings. But if I have it handy usually I'm fine. As for dealing with them, it can be hard. Usually just pushing through. Or finding something to do to keep my hands and mind busy | 2015-02-25T20:25:23+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | Today, I wanted to ask you about smoking and alcohol use. Is there a connection between the two in your personal experience? #TDII | 10 | I hear you - those cravings can be quite hard to deal with. I really like your strategies though - keeping hands and mind busy are great ideas. What also works for many people I talk to is keeping the mouth busy as well. For example with sugarfree gum, hard candy, something to chew on like a straw or toothpick. Maybe something you want to check out sometime. | 2015-02-25T20:29:21+0000

Is there a connection between the two in your personal experience? #TDII | 12 | I think we had a great discussion today 10113 - I've got to run soon, but I still would like to give you some information in the interest of being comprehensive: I don't want to push the idea of quitting down your throat, this is something you have to want for yourself and no one else can make this decision for you, but I need to tell you that light smoking is by no means a "safe" way to use cigarettes and potentially still very harmful. I'd be happy to talk more about this over the next weeks but for now just this piece of information http://www.medicaldaily.com/teen-smoking-even-light-amounts-harmful-overall-physical-health-317792 see you next week! | 2015-02-25T20:38:09+0000

10097 | Participant | User generated post |  | n/a |  | So I decided to try to quit smoking and haven't had a cigarette since Friday night (February 6th). Does anybody have any advice/tools to help one quit? I've been trying to use one of my friend's vaporizers and it isn't really for me, but I'm really interested in getting an e-cigarette to wean me off of nicotine as well as help me with my oral fixation.

100005594500096 | Tsp Study | TSP other post |  | n/a |  | This group is for 18-25 year olds who smoke that want to learn more information about tobacco, how it affects your body, and the different quitting options available. Once you get more information about smoking and connect with other young adults who are in the same boat, you can decide if you want to make a change. Getting educated is the first step to making the right decision for YOU. This group has been randomly selected to have Weekly Incentives; you can accumulate $7 at the end of every week in which you comment every day, for a gift card of up to $90 at the end of the session. | 0 | n/a | 2014-10-14T05:19:46+0000
