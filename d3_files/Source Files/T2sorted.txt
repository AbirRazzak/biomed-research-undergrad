What would make quitting more important to you? #TDII | 2 | Some people start out too fast or exercise too much and burn out after thinking about keeping up a regular exercise routine if they donâ€™t already exercise regularly. Keep these things in mind:1. Start Gradually2. Set limited goals. For example:Week 1 = exercise 10 minutes every other day.Week 2 = add 5 minutes to your exercise time.Week 3 = add another 5 minutes to your exercise time.3.  Give yourself a one-month trial period.During the first few weeks, you should expect some initial discomfort while you gain strength and endurance. 4.  Be aware that achieving a high level of fitness after being out of shape takes about 3 to 4 months. | 2015-01-15T02:11:07+0000
