Have you also tried to mix up the situations in which you are vaping? This may be important for your body to unlearn some of the craving and the connection between a certain setting and nicotine. | 2015-08-19T23:25:35+0000
10261 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | With the 90 days being almost over I am curious to hear about your experience: What is the most important thing you have learned from TSP? #TDII | 7 | I'm very random with it.

Unfortunately, we can't choose how strong of a withdrawal reaction our body gives us... I think you are on the right track though with slowly decreasing the nicotine content and I understand that you are afraid of reducing to 0 nicotine. Have you also been practicing other strategies to cope with cravings and withdrawal? What has been most helpful? | 2015-08-19T23:37:07+0000

One thing you could do to work your way towards 0mg nicotine is to gradually decrease your concentration even further but still not go down to 0. Or you could try to keep track of your puffs and reduce the number of puffs you take each day or increase the time interval between puffs. Any of these sound like they may help? | 2015-08-19T23:43:49+0000

I was wondering if one could custom-mix different concentrations to go even lower, but maybe that's not possible? So another way may be to slowly vape less. Have you thought about giving it a try? | 2015-08-20T00:10:06+0000

10283 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What is currently your biggest smoking trigger? #TDII | 3 | A mixture of angry and annoyed.

10283 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What do you guys like about smoking? #TDII | 1 | I like the feeling of stress relief. Although it feels like stress is being washed away, I know the stress is just from the last cigarette. Which tricks the brain in to thinking a cigarette reduces situational stress. | 2015-07-16T00:31:30+0000

What do they think about your smoking? #TDII | 22 | Glad to hear it 10261! I recommend you try to switch things up in terms of the situations you use your vape in. Because a big part of quitting smoking is unlearning all the situational triggers - so try to not use it in the same situations in which you smoked before. | 2015-07-02T01:10:02+0000

If you have a fresh taste in your mouth smoking may be less appealing. Also gum, mints, or something else to chew on like toothpicks may help. What do you think? | 2015-06-25T00:39:20+0000

Unfortunately studies are showing that they are not any more effective than a placebo.

Haha. I would NOT miss the financial burden, odor, and disappearing every 45 minutes for a smoke when I have important things to do. | 2015-06-18T01:12:20+0000

It's of course totally up to you what you want to try - I'll support you either way! NRT can be useful for helping with withdrawal and craving, but you can also make it work without NRT, for sure! One more thing we'll work on over the next weeks is relapse prevention. | 2015-06-18T01:55:49+0000

Making a plan definitely does increase chances of success. Other strategies that tend to work well are to tell people in your life you are planing to quit and to get rid of smoking paraphernalia as the quit date gets closer. Do you think those could work for you? | 2015-06-11T03:05:19+0000

But at least if you get rid of everything as much as you can it will be slightly harder (hopefully). If you guys are dealing with cravings that would make it hard not to smoke, in addition to getting rid of smoking paraphernalia (e.g., ashtrays) that can trigger you, medication or nicotine replacement therapy may help. | 2015-06-11T03:11:20+0000

I have too much going on mentally I will not take medication unless absolutely necessary. It's not fun when a medication has an ill side effect. Last time I tried to quit with meds it left me suicidal. Nope. Not at all. Nicotine replacement I've tried it all. Not once had it worked. | 2015-06-11T03:14:14+0000

What have been your biggest triggers to smoke lately? | 9 | I appreciate that challenge, 10215. That is why it is important to figure out a good stately for handling social situations when you quit. In the beginning, it may be necessary to stay away from alcohol (huge trigger) and maybe even some smoking friends if that's what you need to get through the first few daysâ€¦best to figure out a plan that will work for you.

When you are first quitting, I recommend using them often, in part because you may get lots of cravings. They can help you "surf the urge" to smoke. Riding it out for the 3-5 mins a craving lastsâ€¦.then as your craving reduce you may be able to use it less often. Remind me how much you smoke now? | 2015-06-03T23:52:00+0000

If you are particularly afraid of withdrawals, you may want to consider nicotine replacement therapy (patch, gum, lozenge). Or medication (bupropion, verenicline).

1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TSP other post |  | n/a |  | Some people start out too fast or exercise too much and burn out after thinking about keeping up a regular exercise routine if they donâ€™t already exercise regularly. Keep these things in mind:1. Start Gradually2. Set limited goals.For example:Week 1 = exercise 10 minutes every other day.Week 2 = add 5 minutes to your exercise time.Week 3 = add another 5 minutes to your exercise time.3.  Give yourself a one-month trial period.During the first few weeks, you should expect some initial discomfort while you gain strength and endurance. 4.  Be aware that achieving a high level of fitness after being out of shape takes about 3 to 4 months. | 0 | n/a | 2015-07-23T23:49:25+0000

1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TSP other post response comment | 10285 10215  | n/a |  |  | 4 | Hi 10215 and 10285 - yes, I have a couple of thoughts on the issue: There are certainly different ways to go about it. In my experience the best approach is to keep trying to quit completely! The problem with continuing to smoke a reduced number of cigs is that many smokers will kind of compensate by inhaling deeper, for example. And this unfortunately does not reduce the negative health effects very much. What you want to do and how you want to do it is totally up to you, but I'd be happy to support you either way to reach your goal! | 2015-06-18T01:20:08+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TSP other post response comment | 10283  | n/a |  |  | 5 | 10283 - yes, I also smoked when I was younger. However, I never smoked heavily because I have allergies etc., so my lungs gave me pretty immediate feedback that it was not good for me. Not being able to breath properly is a terrible feeling, but the good thing is that it made me quit! | 2015-06-18T01:29:00+0000

However, I never smoked heavily because I have allergies etc., so my lungs gave me pretty immediate feedback that it was not good for me. Not being able to breath properly is a terrible feeling, but the good thing is that it made me quit! | n/a
10285 | Participant | TSP other post response comment | Johannes Thrul  | n/a |  |  | 6 | Thanks Johannes Thrul. I really want to quit smoking and depending on cigarettes to make me feel better in stressful situations. My pockets can't take it anymore and I want to have a child soon | 2015-06-18T11:33:25+0000

10283 | Participant | TSP other post response comment |  | n/a |  |  | 1 | Best advice for succesfully quitting by the quit date I've set? 7/25/2015. | 2015-06-24T23:01:09+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TSP other post response comment | 10283  | n/a |  |  | 2 | Hi 10283. Great, you have already set a quit date, which is the first important step. Additional steps are 2. Get support from family/friends/colleagues. 3. Learn new skills and alternative behaviors for your high risk situations. 4. Depending on how much you smoke, I would definitely recommend that you consider trying some form of nicotine replacement therapy â€“ we know that using these can dramatically decrease your cravings and withdrawal and increase your chances to quit for good. 5. Be prepared for relapse or difficult situations (e.g., alcohol, being around other smokers, stress, etc.). I know this sounds like a lot, but we will cover each of these aspects more in depth over the next weeks (please check out the smoking cessation advice session I'll start tomorrow). How does this sound? Anything there you think may be useful? | 2015-06-25T00:18:23+0000
10283 | Participant | TSP other post response comment |  | n/a |  |  | 3 | I think all 5 recommendations are very useful. I think my biggest hurdle would be finding an alternative to smoking while at work. | 2015-06-25T00:23:03+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TSP other post response comment |  | n/a |  |  | 4 | Yes, that's a concern many of the people I work with have. What do you do at work? And what kind of alternatives can you think of that may work for you? | 2015-06-25T00:28:16+0000
10283 | Participant | TSP other post response comment |  | n/a |  |  | 5 | I run the QA/QC department for a manufacturing company. All I can think of is to eat instead of smoke. I have high metabolism so weight gain isn't a worry. | 2015-06-25T00:30:29+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TSP other post response comment |  | n/a |  |  | 6 | Some alternative you could try: Things that keep your hands busy - like playing a game on your phone for example. Or you could try gum, mints, chew on toothpicks, or other healthy snacks for example. Is smoking with your co-workers in breaks an issue for you? | 2015-06-25T00:37:24+0000
10283 | Participant | TSP other post response comment |  | n/a |  |  | 7 | I've made it a point to smoke alone, makes my job easier. Here's the thing, the FDA doesn't allow food in the environment I work in. I can only eat in my office or breakroom which is where I reside like 10% of the time I'm working. I could try downloading a game; that's a good idea. | 2015-06-25T00:45:30+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TSP other post response comment |  | n/a |  |  | 8 | Sure, just give it a try - it can't hurt right? Other options to keep your hands busy may be a stress ball or something like that, or you could start playing with a Rubik's cube if you are interested in solving puzzles :) | 2015-06-25T00:50:43+0000
10283 | Participant | TSP other post response comment |  | n/a |  |  | 9 | I will certainly give that a try. Thanks, Johannes! | 2015-06-25T01:33:39+0000
