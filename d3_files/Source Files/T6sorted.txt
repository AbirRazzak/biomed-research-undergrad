Would you consider using varenicline? #beingconscious | 1 | It seems very interesting.  I personally wouldn't want to take it, but it looks like it works based on what I read.  If a person isn't concerned about taking a drug, I would recommend giving it a try.  The side effects don't seem that bad, apart from the off chance of it making you have suicidal thoughts. | 2015-07-28T19:15:08+0000

10194 | Participant | TSP daily post response comment |  | #beingconscious | 79 | #79: What have you heard about bupropion to help people stop smoking? Would you consider taking a medication if it would help you successfully quit? #beingconscious | 1 | Bupropion, aka welbutrin, is an antidepressant. It would seem therefore that this drug should be used to treat a potential underlying cause of addiction, rather than marketed as a blanket remedy | 2015-07-23T19:55:19+0000

I think hallucinogens have great potential for helping people get over addictions. Check out this research at Johns Hopkins on magic mushrooms and smoking cessation: http://hub.jhu.edu/2014/09/11/magic-mushrooms-smoking I want to mention though that in these trials, the drugs themselves are a component of a larger treatment program and we certainly can't expect that everyone just has to pop mushrooms or LSD once and everything will be fine, but the research and the potential is definitely very exciting. | 2015-07-27T23:02:21+0000

1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment | 10218  | #TDII |  | What is currently your biggest smoking trigger? #TDII | 2 | Hi 10218, these are common triggers that many people struggle with. What have you been trying to cope with these situations other than smoking a cigarette? | 2015-07-23T00:09:27+0000
10218 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What is currently your biggest smoking trigger? #TDII | 3 | I've been "grounding" and meditating. | 2015-07-23T00:09:47+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What is currently your biggest smoking trigger? #TDII | 4 | That's interesting! What do you mean by grounding? | 2015-07-23T00:13:36+0000
10218 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What is currently your biggest smoking trigger? #TDII | 5 | I also use this technique for my ptsd: Grounding is a particular type of coping strategy that is designed to "ground" you in or immediately connect you with the present moment. Grounding is often used as a way of coping with flashbacks or dissociation. In this way, grounding can be considered a variant of mindfulness.Grounding techniques often use the five senses (sound, touch, smell, taste, and sight) to immediately connect people with the here and now. | 2015-07-23T00:26:35+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment | 10218  | #TDII |  | What is currently your biggest smoking trigger? #TDII | 6 | Very cool 10218 - yes that does sound a lot like mindfulness. How successful were these strategies in helping you not smoke? | 2015-07-23T00:29:28+0000
10218 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What is currently your biggest smoking trigger? #TDII | 7 | Very.  It's been rough but I'm 18 days clean! | 2015-07-23T00:30:23+0000
10218 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What is currently your biggest smoking trigger? #TDII | 8 | The grounding works the best honestly.  It's helps me to get out of my repetitive and obsessive thoughts that come with my cravings. | 2015-07-23T00:31:13+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment | 10218  | #TDII |  | What is currently your biggest smoking trigger? #TDII | 9 | That's great to hear 10218 - keep up the good work! I have another recommendation if you are into deep breathing and relaxation. You may want to give it a shot: | 2015-07-23T00:36:36+0000
10218 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What is currently your biggest smoking trigger? #TDII | 10 | I will definitely do that.  I need to get into a daily routine of doing this. | 2015-07-23T00:37:39+0000

10218 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What do you guys like about smoking? #TDII | 1 | It helped with stress, I love the taste, and i liked that it was something to do. I enjoyed a cigar yesterday because I'm on vacation but apart from that I've been sticking to my vape. | 2015-07-15T23:14:25+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment | 10218  | #TDII |  | What do you guys like about smoking? #TDII | 2 | Thanks for sharing 10218! It sounds like you purposefully smoked yesterday, but you are not planning to going back to it? What are you current plans for using your vape in the future? | 2015-07-15T23:17:54+0000
10218 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What do you guys like about smoking? #TDII | 3 | Yes, i just smoked it because it was a special occasion.  I'm in Charleston with my family and my dad and I wanted to share a cigar on the beach.  I don't know what my plans are with my vape.  I really feel like it makes me want to smoke cigarettes.  When i use it to help with triggers it works well, but when I'm using it for boredom I just crave them.  I've been trying to stick to using it when I'm around other smokers because of that. | 2015-07-15T23:23:34+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment | 10218  | #TDII |  | What do you guys like about smoking? #TDII | 4 | That sounds interesting 10218, so on the one hand your vape helps you to deal with cravings, on the other hand it can also produce cravings when you use it in different situations. Have you given any thought to things you could do when you are bored other than vaping? (sounds like these are your high risk situations) | 2015-07-15T23:28:56+0000
10218 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What do you guys like about smoking? #TDII | 5 | Yes.  Usually scrolling through Facebook is enough, and when I'm at home doing my normal routine I can find things to do like draw or read, but I've realized that being on vacation is much different.  Lots of people smoke on the beach and pier as well as in front of restaurants and I have a lot of free time around that.  I've been boogie boarding and tanning as well as walking around the shops, but that only goes so far. | 2015-07-15T23:35:46+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What do you guys like about smoking? #TDII | 6 | Sounds like you are in a somewhat unusual situation at the moment with plenty of smokers around and not all that much to do to keep you occupied. I wonder if there are other fun things you could do when you are bored? Reading, watching a TV show or a movie, listening to music, working out? What do you think? | 2015-07-15T23:40:18+0000
10218 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What do you guys like about smoking? #TDII | 7 | I should sit on the beach and read my book.  Listening to music isn't all that helpful unless it's slow jazz or Bonobo, which/whom I love, but get tired of quickly. I'll give that a try as well.  Thanks for the tips, I was drawing a blank and desperately in need of distraction. | 2015-07-15T23:45:51+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What do you guys like about smoking? #TDII | 8 | Sure anytime :) Maybe a combination of slow Jazz/Bonobo and reading when you get tired of the music is something that could work and distract you. Maybe you could also practice your drawing skills? The beach may not be the ideal location, but maybe worth a try? | 2015-07-15T23:48:38+0000
10218 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What do you guys like about smoking? #TDII | 9 | I'm far enough away from the pier and it's late enough in the day that I don't have to be too worried about smokers. | 2015-07-15T23:52:15+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What do you guys like about smoking? #TDII | 10 | Sounds like you're good for today! Tomorrow when it get's bad again and you hit a high risk situations try some of the strategies we have talked about today. It can't hurt to try, right? | 2015-07-15T23:54:41+0000

My mother used to call alcohol "Mommy Juice" and "only mommies can drink it after a hard day's work" and I never had an interest in drinking until I was a teen and heard otherwise (It did kinda blow my mind at first that there were middle school kids drinking though) So I guess you could say that strategy works pretty well.

Of course she had to deal with that because of her oral cancer, but there were other, less destructive forms of treatment she could have chosen.  It doesn't surprise me that she got cancer again, considering how common recurrences are with chemo.  It's considered a successful treatment if your cancer doesn't come back for 5 years.  Not forever.  Cancer is still very difficult to treat and doctors tend to push chemo/radiation for varying reasons, mostly because it's the "most successful."  Overall, this video is misleading.  Also, as mentioned in the last video like this, extreme cases aren't very convincing to smokers. | 2015-06-30T19:32:01+0000

I could probably sit here and count all the things but it would take too long.  I will point out, however, that if these are the e-cigs you guys are studying and using for comparison, I don't think you're using the right kind.  Of course those are horrible.  You should be studying the vape pens that are so popular.  They use 3 or 4 ingredients in their juice. Or at the very least, don't lump the two together. | 2015-06-26T20:24:37+0000

Their master plan isn’t so under-the-radar! #ecig | 3 | Great points, you guys! | 2015-06-29T19:23:49+0000

10218 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | I know stopping smoking is not easy. How confident are you that you could quit smoking if you tried? #TDII | 1 | I decided to quit last week and I've only had one since then.  I've been usi ng vape pens when they're around but only becausw they're much safer.  Not perfect, but much better.  There are only 3 ingredients in the juice and the wick is 100 percent organic cotton. | 2015-06-25T00:19:07+0000

That's a big success and you can be proud of yourself! Do you already know how you want to use your ecig in the future? | 2015-06-25T00:25:16+0000

How confident are you that you could quit smoking if you tried? #TDII | 4 | I was just asking because also ecigs are not without risk and may potentially still be harmful for your health (even though most likely way less harmful than regular cigs). We simply don't know enough about them yet, and they are not regulated by the FDA, so we also can't be entirely sure what's in them. I just want to give you my reasons why I can't recommend their use 100%. I'll keep checking in with you over the next couple of weeks to see how your quitting is going. But for now: Great job! | 2015-06-25T00:32:59+0000

Stress is a big time trigger for many people I work with. We can try to come up with alternatives to smoking that can help with stress reduction. What else could you do when you are stressed out? | 2015-06-18T01:59:44+0000
10218 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | Hi guys, I'm back from my trip. How have you been and what's your current smoking status? #TDII | 5 | Well I often resort to eating when I don't want to smoke, but I know that's not a good habit either.  Working out only helps so much because I love to smoke after I work out.  The most productive thing for me is waiting 5 minutes to smoke.  Quite often it ends up being half an hourm | 2015-06-18T02:03:31+0000

What are people dealing with this week? Has anyone in this group tried to quit smoking? If so, how did it go? If not, what is getting in your way? | 1 | I like to leave you guys with tips in these session, so today, here is our 5-step TSP quit plan. See if something resonates with you: 1. GET READY.• Set a quit date and stick to it – not even a single puff! 2. GET SUPPORT AND ENCOURAGEMENT.• Tell your family, friends and coworkers you are quitting.• Talk to your doctor or other health care provider.• Get group, individual, or telephone counseling. Think about who can support you with quitting smoking3. LEARN NEW SKILLS AND BEHAVIORS.• When you first try to quit, change your routine.• Reduce stress.• Distract yourself from urges to smoke.• Plan something enjoyable to do every day.• Drink a lot of water and other fluids. Think about which of these will be most helpful to you?4. GET MEDICATION AND USE IT CORRECTLY.Talk with your health care provider about which medication will work best for you:• Medication: bupropion, verenicline (prescription).• Nicotine Replacement:-gum and patch are over-the-counter-inhaler and nasal spray are prescriptionIs there one of these that you think would be helpful for you?5. BE PREPARED FOR RELAPSE OR DIFFICULT SITUATIONS.• Avoid alcohol.• Be careful around other smokers.• Improve your mood in ways other than smoking.• Eat a healthy diet and stay active. | 2015-06-11T04:03:03+0000

Why do you think so many people are ready to adopt them even before proper research has been conducted? #ecig | 1 | Cheap ecigs have lots of toxins in them.  You can find ecig juice that has only three or four ingredients.  When I'm off work I'll post some examples.  And to answer your question, most people are uninformed consumers. | 2015-05-29T19:02:41+0000

Even matches/lighters/ashtrays. EVERYTHING! | 2015-05-27T23:57:58+0000

I got really close to quitting doing it that way once but we lost the pen :/ | 2015-05-16T20:24:38+0000

I also don't eat much dairy at all! I avoid dairy whenever I can. I'm not lactose intolerant, but my boyfriend is, and I just feel like Almond milk is a lot healthier and easier to digest. Plus, my dentist told me that by drinking 1 glass of almond milk per day, I am preventing osteoporosis and keeping my teeth strong moreso than regular cow milk. I think the most important part of your diet is keeping preservatives, artificial colors and flavors, and fake sugar out of your food. From there, your body will help itself regulate. Naturally, your body is attracted to foods with high protein. Smoothies are great! I don't think my diet would change much other than I'd probably eat a bit more if I quit cigarettes. | 2015-05-14T23:24:17+0000

Let me know if you have any questions! #TDII | 1 | What, in your opinion, are the most helpful things'll quit smoking? Also, I'm 10245 nice to meet you. | 2015-05-14T00:02:24+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment | 10245  | #TDII |  | Hi everyone and welcome to TSP! I am available for the next hour. Let me know if you have any questions! #TDII | 2 | Hi 10245 - nice to meet you, too! That’s the million dollar question :) There are several aspects to it: 1. I would recommend to pick a quit day and following through with it. 2. Get support from family/friends/colleagues. 3. Learn new skills and alternative behaviors for your high risk situations. 4. Depending on how much you smoke, I would definitely recommend that you consider trying some form of nicotine replacement therapy – we know that using these can dramatically decrease your cravings and withdrawal and increase your chances to quit for good. 5. Be prepared for relapse or difficult situations (e.g., alcohol, being around other smokers, stress, etc.). I know this sounds like a lot, but we will cover each of these aspects more in depth over the next weeks. How does this sound? Anything there you think may be useful? | 2015-05-14T00:06:06+0000
10218 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | Hi everyone and welcome to TSP! I am available for the next hour. Let me know if you have any questions! #TDII | 3 | 1. Do you recommend quitting cold turkey or weaning off?2. What's the best form of nicotine replacement?  I tried the gum and hated it.  I tried the ecig but it just made me want to smoke cigarettes (I love the taste of tobacco.)3.  As someone who is very addicted to cigarettes, do you think I would be able to stick to smoking only when I drink?  Or do you think that will just make me smoke again?  I drink about once a week, probably more now that it's summer, but during the school year once a week or less. | 2015-05-14T00:16:11+0000

1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment | 10218  | #TDII |  | Hi everyone and welcome to TSP! I am available for the next hour. Let me know if you have any questions! #TDII | 7 | OK 10218 - I think with 10 cig/day you could still consider quitting without any nicotine replacement, even though replacement is going to make coping with urges and withdrawal easier. If you decide to do so, you may want to try the patch as an option. Another avenue may be to gradually reduce the number of cigs you smoke every day. Some things you could try there: Pick certain cigarettes you want to eliminate (e.g. the first or last one each day, a cigarette after a meal), you could also think about declaring smoke free zones to get you to smoke less (e.g. stop smoking in your car). Yet another way would be to gradually increase the time interval between cigarettes. What you are willing to try is really up to you – I simply want to give you comprehensive information so you can make an informed decision. | 2015-05-14T00:23:06+0000

10218 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | Hi everyone and welcome to TSP! I am available for the next hour. Let me know if you have any questions! #TDII | 10 | I think a combination of making places smoke free and picking certain cigarettes to eliminate.  And something that you sort of mentioned but not quite, if I want a cigarette I could wait 10 minutes and see if I still want one then, eventually making the time intervals longer. | 2015-05-14T00:33:45+0000

That will make it easier. What else could you do while your in the car to distract yourself when you're craving a smoke? | 2015-05-14T00:43:38+0000
10218 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | Hi everyone and welcome to TSP! I am available for the next hour.

1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment | 10222  | #TDII |  | Hi everyone and welcome to TSP! I am available for the next hour. Let me know if you have any questions! #TDII | 18 | Hi 10222 - glad you're here. First off, it's great that you were able to reduce the number of cigs you smoke so drastically. Great question about e-cigs. The problem with e-cigs is that there is no clear data up to now showing that they really help smokers quit. Also, they are not regulated by the FDA, which means that it is unclear what is in them. For all we know, they may still be harmful to your health, even though I think it's fair so say that they are probably a lot safer than regular cigs. I would recommend using nicotine replacement therapy over e-cigs: gum, patch, inhaler (prescription), or lozenge (prescription). Also, other prescription medication like zyban or chantix can be effective, but you have to talk to your doctor first to get a prescription. What you are willing to try is really up to you – I simply want to give you comprehensive information so you can make an informed decision... and again I think it's great that you reduced your number of cigs! | 2015-05-14T01:03:46+0000
10222 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | Hi everyone and welcome to TSP! I am available for the next hour. Let me know if you have any questions! #TDII | 19 | Ok, I'll try some of those, most of em I have tried but they didnt give, I guess the mental satisfaction of the gestures of the habit, plan I have now is to use different levels of nicotine to tapper myself off nicotine completely | 2015-05-14T01:07:41+0000
10222 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | Hi everyone and welcome to TSP! I am available for the next hour. Let me know if you have any questions! #TDII | 20 | I went fro a pack to 1.5 packs a day to 1 cigs a day literally over night | 2015-05-14T01:08:32+0000

I have been a little underweight most of my life due to low blood pressure and high metabolism that runs in my family. Never been concerned about my weight other than wanting to gain a couple pounds! Not only that, but outside of smoking cigarettes, I try my best to be a healthy person. I only eat preservative free food and organic when I can. I seldom ever eat fast food, why pay $5 at Taco Bell for crap when you can spend $8 at the hot bar in Whole Foods and get a pound of whatever food you want! and it is so much better! So weight gain is and has never been a factor in my smoking. If anything, I would welcome the better appetite because sometimes I have trouble with that. I am coming up to 2 years in my grief so the gut-wrenching depression every single day has thankfully subsided and I am in the process of returning to my "New Normal". I hope that reducing my smoking habit is part of that! | 2015-05-12T22:46:07+0000

10255 | Participant | TSP daily post response comment |  | #balance | 6 | #6: What would be the best-case scenario if you quit smoking? #balance | 3 | I would love to stop smoking for at least 1 year before planning to try for another baby. I lost my son to SIDS 2 years ago, believe me I have been guilted by the smoking. I did not smoke during my pregnancy, but I smoked 2-3 cigs a day while breast feeding.... :( My son died at 2 months 2 weeks. I never smoked anywhere near him, I would wash my hands, brush my teeth, and I had a special overcoat I would only wear while smoking so that my regular clothes would not smell.... but apparently wasn't enough. Still don't know how I feel about cigs in relation to SIDS. I have been told by other moms that my smoking was not related to my son's death. But SIDS is so unknown how could we know for sure? The guilt will always be there. I just know I don't want to be smoking with my next child. I don't want to take ANY risks :( | 2015-05-11T19:56:35+0000
10255 | Participant | TSP daily post response comment |  | #balance | 6 | #6: What would be the best-case scenario if you quit smoking? #balance | 4 | The unfortunate part about it all is that his death is what bumped me back up to smoking from 2-3 cigs to 6-7 cigs in a day. Even the police who came the day he died (we had called 911 because we woke up to him unresponsive. This is apparently common for SIDS to wake in the morning to find an unresponsive baby...:( ) the POLICE BOUGHT ME A PACK OF CIGS. It was a nice gesture of them, I was grateful at the time, but it may have increased my need for cigs because obviously that was the most traumatic day in my entire life. I would never want to re live that horrible day, June 7th 2013. But trust me, losing my son has not made quitting any easier... | 2015-05-11T19:58:45+0000

It comes from a biological interest in wanting to taste things from when we are children. Try it. | 2015-05-05T00:37:16+0000

10255 | Participant | TSP daily post response comment |  | #motivation | 3 | #3: How would you support someone who tells you they want to quit smoking? #motivation | 8 | I respect people who quit or are trying to quit. I never offer them cigs and try not to smoke near them. If they ask me for a cig I don't just hand it to them. I ask, "Are you sure? I Thought you were trying to quit" because I would want someone to remind me too. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. | 2015-05-11T20:19:13+0000

To have you remain a loyal customer? To help you quit smoking? Other ideas? #ecig | 2 | The ecigs big tobacco companies make are horrible for you.  Many people (at least in my town) buy the ecigs (i think they're called vape pens) with giant batteries and coils with adjustable temps where you drip the liquid in.  They get them online or buy the parts and make it/adjust it themselves.  I rarely see people with the cheap $40 ecigs you buy at a cigarette shop.  We're also lucky to have a smoke shop that makes its own ecig juice and it only has 3 or 4 ingredients.  It's extremely popular in the vaping scene and not that expensive.  I worry about Big Tobacco taking control of ecig production because they don't care about the customer, they just want money (like any mega corp) and will use cheap, toxic products. | 2015-05-10T18:12:57+0000

I'm no expert though, I'll admit. | 2015-05-10T18:24:33+0000

Other ideas? #ecig | 6 | It's the same principal as a fake competitor in the economic system, a big company isn't moving products fast enough so they create a " competitor" so now people have two options but the money is still going back to the same place. And as for the keeping you a customer YESSSSS very much so, everyone who has smoked an e-cig knows that there is nothing that compares to a real cigaret, even the self rolled ones, so people buy the e-cig, try it out, and then realize why they smoked cigarets so yeah it's a way to keep you hooked to the old style. Besides that's what they want you to stick to, they already have all the setups to produce Tabacco, if they needed to change everything to supply the world with e-cigs it would be a loss in one way or another, and we all know they cant possibly afford that.

Also, ecigs can get you really hooked on nicotine but without the MAOi's found in tobacco, meaning that the companies have two addicting products, and the one they're most heavily invested in has further reinforcement for the addiction. | 2015-05-11T18:20:07+0000

I've been smoking since I was 14, regularly since I was 15.  I've switched to additive free cigarettes because regular ones make me feel sick.  The two kinds I smoke are Kentucky's Best (5.79/pack) and American Spirits (8/pack).  Over the past year breathing has become difficult.  I used to be a singer but I stopped after an embarassing performance where I ran out of breath in the middle of a song and haven't done it since.  I would love to quit completely or maybe stick to when I'm drinking. | 2015-05-06T23:05:18+0000

In January I quit for 3 weeks cold turkey. A stressful home situation got the best of me and I started again. I smoke pyramid lights about $4.54 a pack here. It's one of the cheaper routes in ohio. I want to quit smoking for 2 reasons. One being my fiance constantly bringing it up since I started back up. Two is due to my diabetes. It takes a harsh toll on my body. I can be as active as I want to be. I'm sure it will be a pleasure to participate in this program with you all. | 2015-05-07T16:46:48+0000

I have a beautiful Angel Son named Miles, forever 2 months 2 weeks old. March 25th 2013 - June 7th 2013. I have a kitty girl named Tikal who is going to be 12 this year. I have been smoking on and off for most of my life. My mother is a "religious" smoker, she smokes a pack of maraboro reds every single day, and has done so my entire life. As far as I know, she did reduce her smoking greatly while pregnant with me, but still smoked occassionally. I dont know how long after giving birth to me she continued, but by the time I was a young child I remember her in the backyard with her cigarette. In her defense, she never smoked inside until I was 13.  (you have to remember this was back in the late 90's early 00's so there wasn't as much info)I tried my first smoke at 12 years old while my parents were going through a nasty divorce. My dad and I had a terrible relationship but I was stuck living with him due to the divorce arrangement at the time, and after a fight with him, I took a cigarette butt I had taken from my mother's ash tray one day out of curiosity, and lit it up. The stress from being angry with my dad went away and that is how I became hooked. Luckily at the time, being 12, I wasn't able to get more cigs. I still smoked cigs here and there throughout my teens but not very often at all. On average, maybe 10 cigs in a -year-. But once I was 18, and at the time living with my mother, I began smoking again. Me and her were not getting along, I broke up with my fiance that I was supposed to be married to, I went through a bout of homelessness. It was during this time my smoking was at its worst.I smoked at least a pack a day, sometimes 2 packs in a day of Camel Crush, Pall Mall, Marlboro, and L&M during this time period from 18-19. Thankfully my life slowed down and got less chaotic for a while right before I turned 20. I found a place to live with family friends, and got with my current boyfriend Damian in 2012. I reduced my smoking and switched to American Spirits. I made the change because I felt like by switching to a natural cigarette, it was a healthier choice. I still only ever smoke American Spirits when I do smoke cigarettes. I refuse to even try anything else. I don't like the way other cigs smell. I feel like I can smell the chemicals.Even if American Spirits aren't healthier for me, I just feel like they are better choice for me at this time. I smoke less of them, I could never smoke a whole pack in a day. They last longer, burn slower, and according to the box, they seem to at least care about the environment. I started to quit smoking on my own before I found out I was pregnant with my son in June 2012. I started quitting because they didn't taste right and didn't feel right. Then I found out I was pregnant and I quit instantly without any problems. The smell of cigs began to piss me off and give me a headache throughout my whole pregnancy, so I did not smoke nor stand around anyone who was smoking.I had an extremely stressful birth process. I was a week late and had to be induced. After 38 hours of labor, my placenta ruptured and they had to do an Emergency C Section. I almost died and so did my son. My son was not breathing for the first 2-5 minutes of his life. By a miracle he started crying and was fine. He passed all his screening tests and I had my baby boy with me. Unfortunately we had to stay in the hospital for 4 days because of my c section. I was going stir-crazy in there, what with all the nurses bugging me here and there, I had an allergic reaction to my IV, it was just hell. Couldn't wait to get home.Sadly the anticipation gave me enough time and stress and anger to want another cig. So I started my mildest smoking regimen ever, only 1 cig in the morning, 1 cig at late evening, and 1 cig in the middle of the night. I timed them to be away from times my son breast fed. After my son passed away I have tried to quit a few times. The longest I have quit in the past couple years since 2013 was 2 months. Most recently I quit for 8 days because I had to have my wisdom teeth removed. It was challenging but I was able to quit. It probably would have stuck if it weren't for a bunch of family emergencies coming up right after I had my surgery that involved me being up for over 24 hours, and I was so worn out and tired that I broke down and started smoking. That was in March, and I have been smoking ever since. Sorry about the long post I just figured the more info you have, the better. Thanks for reading <3 | 2015-05-11T20:17:02+0000

They are easy to hide. And kids can get away with them at school if they are smart about it. | 2015-05-09T18:05:11+0000

But I feel as if some of our youth like the idea of breaking the law or just the general feeling of being rebellious. I was somewhat of a "troublemaker" when I was younger and cigarettes were my first way of acting out. | 2015-05-09T19:09:01+0000

I always wanted to get the thick smoke and blow o-rings or do other smoke tricks.  I always believed it was safer without looking at the facts (which there aren't enough of.)  I bought my first e-cig when I was 16 and I puffed on it for hours at a time, only stopping when I got lightheaded.  The thing is, it never stopped me from smoking cigarettes because I never used it properly.  In fact, I bet it caused me to smoke more because my body got used to higher levels of niccotine. I like the e-cig juice you can buy online or in a smoke shop (my local smoke shop makes their own) because they only have three or four ingredients.  I think if used properly, e-cigs are great for people who really do want an alternative.  The problem is that most people (based on my perception, which is quite limited) don't use it that way. | 2015-05-09T21:33:22+0000

On one point, since they are smoke-free, they don't have the same carcinogens that cig smoke has, but on another point, the long term effects of e cigs have not been studied. So we don't know for sure if they are safer | 2015-05-11T19:53:25+0000
