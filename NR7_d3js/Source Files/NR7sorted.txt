Aside from not knowing who half these people are... I assume they are on this celebrity list for a reason. They a huge influence on people who follow pop culture some of them, religiously. So I think it's awesome! Good for them for doing so and promoting a healthy lifestyle.... But think about all the things celebrities do that influence peopl. I mean for fucks sake "Beleibers" were cutting themselves over something stupid. These... People, these celebrities have such a pull over people and most of them either don't care and let people blindly follow or do things that obviously influence followers. More celebrities need to model Emma Watson, she is using her influence for good! Others.. Eh. I think some try but fail horribly, and honestly it's our fault. We constantly poke into these people's lives and never give them a moment of privacy, imagine if someone was watching you every second of every day and exploiting everything you did... Yeah. Fuck that. We need to wake up people. | 2015-09-23T20:04:35+0000

And 100 percent of people who breathe air, drink water, or consume products are going to die. At least I've got an idea as to how it's likely to happen. | 2015-09-18T19:16:27+0000

10374 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | With the 90 days being almost over I am curious to hear about your experience: What is the most important thing you have learned from TSP? #TDII | 1 | That convincing someone to quit smoking and convincing someone to not smoke require vastly different methods, and the former seems much more difficult than the latter. | 2015-09-16T23:20:31+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment | 10374  | #TDII |  | With the 90 days being almost over I am curious to hear about your experience: What is the most important thing you have learned from TSP? #TDII | 2 | Hi 10374 - good to hear from you. So do you mean convincing someone to quit is much harder than convincing someone to not take it up in the first place? | 2015-09-16T23:22:35+0000
10374 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | With the 90 days being almost over I am curious to hear about your experience: What is the most important thing you have learned from TSP? #TDII | 3 | Seems that way. Honestly this whole thing has felt less like a study and more like a campaign. Unless the study was to see how we would react to such strong bias coupled with fear tactics and other marketing techniques, in which case I feel that it has strengthened many of our resolve not to quit. | 2015-09-16T23:26:21+0000
10374 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | With the 90 days being almost over I am curious to hear about your experience: What is the most important thing you have learned from TSP? #TDII | 4 | That's just based on what I've seen though. | 2015-09-16T23:26:40+0000

I would also be curious what you think would be more effective to get people like yourself thinking about the pros and cons of smoking and quitting? | 2015-09-16T23:31:02+0000
10374 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | With the 90 days being almost over I am curious to hear about your experience: What is the most important thing you have learned from TSP? #TDII | 6 | I think that if you honestly want to get people to quit smoking, it's not about making them think about the pros and cons, I haven't met a smoker who isn't completely aware of the pros and cons. I think it would be more effective to look at the situation from our point of view. Use empathy rather than sympathy. You have to, on an individual basis, create a common ground tied to the subject, and at least on a one on one level, bare within yourself a similar sort of weakness. It helps for it to be personal, which I think is the main reason it's so difficult. | 2015-09-17T00:18:58+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment | 10374  | #TDII |  | With the 90 days being almost over I am curious to hear about your experience: What is the most important thing you have learned from TSP? #TDII | 7 | Thank you for sharing this with me 10374! If I understand you correctly you're saying it's not about the pros and cons but about a truly personal connection and about understanding your point of view. What sort of content would be more relevant for you in this sort of study? | 2015-09-17T00:30:54+0000
10374 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | With the 90 days being almost over I am curious to hear about your experience: What is the most important thing you have learned from TSP? #TDII | 8 | I'm not sure. I suppose that's part of the issue. Smoking doesn't seem to be as big of a deal for most of us as it seems to be for you guys. The biggest hurdle would be us not wanting to quit, and that's not something that you can force on someone. I would suggest making it seem like the smoker's idea to do so. A good way to do this, I think, would be more heavily supported statistics, facts, and evidence, and a focus on both the would be pros -and- cons. If it showed more that you recognize that we enjoy smoking, or whatever the case may be, and the things posted regular showed that that's taken into consideration, it would have had a greater effect on me. Instead, most of this has just felt impersonal and rife with bias, as though it's being preached from a pedestal rather than discussed on equal footing. | 2015-09-17T00:37:08+0000

One thing I want to say though is that everything we post here is in fact supported by evidence, but I agree that we could post more content to back it up. On the other hand it's always a fine line and we obviously don't want to bother you guys with really long posts all the time. Again, thanks for your feedback! | 2015-09-17T00:53:06+0000

10349 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | With the 90 days being almost over I am curious to hear about your experience: What is the most important thing you have learned from TSP? #TDII | 11 | I honestly don't feel like I've learned anything...

Substances and consumables should only be illegal if their effects immediately endanger the community at large. It is my right to do what I like with my body, no matter how detrimental, so long as I don't hurt others. Laws to help prevent second hand smoke are fine, but if I'm not physically endangering or hurting others I don't want the law getting anywhere near my personal choice to quit, should I make it. | 2015-09-13T19:52:21+0000

The last initiative I heard was several years ago- no smoking 30 ft from a public entrance- however that's almost NEVER enforced. Also I smoke in my car  and work (on breaks) most often so... They can't tell me not to smoke in my car. Haha so I personally think they are inconveniencing everyone with silly petty laws almost no one enforces. Why? Law makers are wasting their time and our money on these laws. | 2015-09-09T19:11:32+0000

Being a relatively low rank in the military, I have to live on base and thus already deal with fairly tight smoking restrictions, such as only being allowed to smoke at designated areas, but I can live with that. | 2015-09-09T19:21:14+0000

10374 | Participant | TSP daily post response comment |  | #socialreflection | 70 | #70: Check out what Big Tobacco companies consider their 'Doomsday Scenario'. What do you think about what their records say? #socialreflection | 1 | It's business. It's them being honest about what makes their money, and what will cause them to make much less of it. More a product of a capitalistic society than the product of anything to do with smoking. | 2015-09-03T19:28:36+0000

Do you think itâ€™s a good idea to make institutions of higher education smoke free? #socialreflection | 1 | I think they should have smoke pits, designated smoking areas so the non-smokers don't have to interact with smoking people, with no smoking everywhere else. I've been living on military installations for the past two years, and it works well enough here. | 2015-09-02T20:42:32+0000

Go away. It's like saying lets have a bike free campus because I don't like bikes buzzing around me.  Plus- I'll smoke where I want anyway..... | 2015-09-02T22:58:24+0000

Do you think itâ€™s a good idea to make institutions of higher education smoke free? #socialreflection | 3 | I think the idea is just a matter of population. If there's nobody around, light up. But it's just a dick move to make others deal with your choice to smoke, and in a heavily populated place like that, there's not always somewhere for them to comfortably leave to. | 2015-09-02T23:01:16+0000

( i understand not indoors ) its a persons choice whether they want to smoke or not | 2015-09-02T23:12:12+0000
10349 | Participant | TSP daily post response comment |  | #socialreflection | 69 | #69: Check out this link to view which U.S. College Campuses and Universities have 100% Smoke-Free ordinances. Do you think itâ€™s a good idea to make institutions of higher education smoke free? #socialreflection | 5 | On some level I totally agree! And idk I think situationally it's all relevant.... I personally would excuse myself from a group of people, dependent on size of the group... If it's 1-5 whatever I don't care, especially if it's outside. Like..... Walk away. It's also not like I'm gonna walk up to a group of people and blow smoke in their face either. But- example--- when I was visiting college campuses... It was a non smoking campus and as I was walking around I was technically "off campus" grounds and at a cross walk smoking and a group of people came up - obviously non smokers- and they just kept their distance from the smell as I made an effort as well to not move closer- or blow smoke in their direction. I think smokers yes need to be conscious of others... But at the same time....non smokers can respect our choice to smoke, outside where permitted or where there is not a smoking restriction anyway. | 2015-09-02T23:17:26+0000

Do you think itâ€™s a good idea to make institutions of higher education smoke free? #socialreflection | 6 | I can see having a mostly smoke free campus. My college is smoke free and they charge a hefty fine if you get caught smoking, even if you're in your own vehicle in the parking lot. I don't mind not being able to smoke in the common space, but I think it's utter crap to penalize somebody for smoking in their own property when they're away from almost everyone else. | 2015-09-02T23:29:03+0000

Do you think itâ€™s a good idea to make institutions of higher education smoke free? #socialreflection | 7 | My campus is smoke free but lots of people still smoke, only now we don't have ashtrays so a lot of people just leave their butts wherever. The only thing being a "smoke free" campus has done is piss people off and made the whole place trashier. Having designated smoking areas would make a lot more sense. | 2015-09-03T02:04:52+0000

10374 | Participant | TSP daily post response comment |  | #socialreflection | 73 | #73: Have you noticed how smoking is portrayed in magazines and advertisements? How do you feel about the way it's represented to the world? #socialreflection | 1 | I feel that for the most part it's not. Most cigarette advertising has been stamped out, from what I've seen. I definitely see more non-smoking ads. I already smoke, and as I feel it's the responsibility of the consumer to understand what they're buying and the risks associated, it's mostly inconsequential to me. | 2015-09-06T19:04:24+0000

How do you feel about the way it's represented to the world? #socialreflection | 4 | Honestly.... I have never seen an ad for smoking in a magazine.... Or on TV. Or on the radio.... I was born in the early 90's long after the major buzz for smoking... And by the time I was at an age to be seeing adverts... Like 10374 said they had all been stamped out. Sooooo... There's that. | 2015-09-06T20:25:56+0000

Secondly, those Newport smokers look like any other person who's having a good time. They do the same with soda ads. | 2015-09-06T21:04:57+0000

Nail polish remover is one of my favorite smells.... And so is "disk cleaner"  kinda gross I inhale a vapor... But I think we all know there are chemicals in cigarettes.... I present a question I've always been curious about though..... In 'additive free' cigarettes... Is that just plain- straight up tobacco? Or do those even have chemicals such as acetone in them? Tsp Study I'd like to know!  Thanks! | 2015-09-05T20:05:06+0000

10349 | Participant | TSP daily post response comment |  | #socialreflection | 71 | #71: How is smoking portrayed on TV? What have you noticed about characters who smoke on TV shows or in movies? #socialreflection | 2 | I really think how it's portrayed depends on what kind of programming you watch... Any "family" or kid stuff aaaaaaaaalways has a negative connotation and blah blah blah or the "bad boy" kind of rep... Where as more dramatic "adult" type shows its just a thing... Like how it is in real life. | 2015-09-04T20:41:08+0000

Others' concern can maybe get us thinking but it likely won't be enough to makes us change our behavior if we don't want to do it ourselves. I remember you were somewhat concerned about some health consequences of smoking you witnessed last week.

10353 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What would you miss most if you quit smoking for good? #TDII | 5 | I think I just about summed it up. Though I guess I'd also having something to distract me when things aren't going well. | 2015-08-27T02:16:51+0000

10353 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What would you miss most if you quit smoking for good? #TDII | 9 | I don't want to get COPD or emphysema or anything like that. I don't want to have a tracheotomy either. I work for a man who has severe breathing issues from smoking, and after an episode today I'm a little scared about it. My spending on cigarettes depends on the week, but anywhere between 28 to 42 dollars a week. I have expensive taste. | 2015-08-27T03:06:39+0000

10353 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What would you miss most if you quit smoking for good? #TDII | 13 | It usually was, but then it dawned on me that I likely wouldn't die from any complications, I'd just be forced to live with them in misery. I'm not at liberty to discuss details, but that's what I observed today with my client. | 2015-08-27T03:22:12+0000

10353 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What would you miss most if you quit smoking for good? #TDII | 15 | It makes me think that I should quit if I don't want to end up in the same state. It also makes me question myself, since I was always so steadfastly in favor of smoking. My client still smokes, despite his situation, and I fear that I might be in his position of I'm not careful. | 2015-08-27T03:32:35+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment | 10353  | #TDII |  | What would you miss most if you quit smoking for good? #TDII | 16 | That does sound like an intense experience 10353. You say if you are not careful you could end up in the same situation as your client. What could you do to be more careful? | 2015-08-27T03:38:24+0000
10353 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What would you miss most if you quit smoking for good? #TDII | 17 | Quit smoking immediately! That's the most relevant factor. Getting more exercise couldn't hurt either. | 2015-08-27T03:40:00+0000

10353 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What would you miss most if you quit smoking for good? #TDII | 19 | I'd stop buying cigarettes, and stop going outside when my loved ones smoke. I'd likely attend the smoking cessation classes they offer at my local hospital. | 2015-08-27T03:50:32+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment | 10353  | #TDII |  | What would you miss most if you quit smoking for good? #TDII | 20 | All of these sound like great strategies 10353! If you are seriously considering quitting these are the 5 things that are most important in my experience: 1. I would recommend to pick a quit day and following through with it. 2. Get support from family/friends/colleagues. 3. Learn new skills and alternative behaviors for your high risk situations. 4. Depending on how much you smoke, I would definitely recommend that you consider trying some form of nicotine replacement therapy â€“ we know that using these can dramatically decrease your cravings and withdrawal and increase your chances to quit for good. 5. Be prepared for relapse or difficult situations (e.g., alcohol, being around other smokers, stress, etc.).  How does this sound? Anything there you think may be useful? | 2015-08-27T03:55:12+0000

Would you hide your e-cig smoking from a child? #ecig | 8 | I would do what my aunt did, hide it completely when I was little, but as I got older and was able to comprehend that cigarettes are bad she made less of an effort | 2015-08-24T22:42:02+0000

At my family reunion, I smoked a cigarette at about 2330 on Friday and didn't have one until about 1800 on Sunday evening. Smoking didn't even cross my mind as I was hanging out with my 2 year old niece the whole time- her clinging to me like a little monkey.... I was thinking about how I can't wait for her to grow up and I can be her cool guncle... Ha smoking isn't a necessity to me. | 2015-08-11T21:40:56+0000

Is there a connection between the two in your personal experience? #TDII | 7 | My bad habits love each other as much as I love them.To be honest, I couldn't tell you exactly what it is that makes me smoke more while drinking, just that cigarettes seem to taste extra delicious after a few beers. | 2015-08-19T23:14:15+0000

10349 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | Today, I wanted to ask you about smoking and alcohol use. Is there a connection between the two in your personal experience? #TDII | 9 | Well I will reiterate what I said then as it still applies 100% so...Ohhhhh laaawwwdddd I can easily smoke 2+ packs in one night if I'm heavily drinking hahaha how could I stop? Uhh... Just.... not I guess?  Haha it would be really hard though... Especially in an inebriated state? That's a toughy!! | 2015-08-19T23:18:39+0000

Is there a connection between the two in your personal experience? #TDII | 10 | 10353 - why smoking and alcohol go together so well is still a hot research question. Probably has to do with a chemical interaction between both substances. But the social context may also have to do with it, since not many young adults drink without friends. So guys, let me ask you this: It seems like situations with alcohol are really high risk for smoking. If you ever wanted to change your smoking what would you do in these situations 10353 10349? | 2015-08-19T23:23:37+0000
10353 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | Today, I wanted to ask you about smoking and alcohol use. Is there a connection between the two in your personal experience? #TDII | 11 | Avoid those types of situations! Or chew on straws instead of smoking cigarettes. But frankly, I don't see that happening. | 2015-08-19T23:33:16+0000

Maybe you will be one day and these strategies may come in handy. How successful do you think they will be if you put them to the test? | 2015-08-19T23:39:42+0000
10353 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | Today, I wanted to ask you about smoking and alcohol use. Is there a connection between the two in your personal experience? #TDII | 13 | Avoiding the situation would probably be very unsuccessful. But chewing on straws actually works because it keeps your mouth and your hands busy, like a cigarette. In sure it can't be that good for you though. | 2015-08-19T23:43:18+0000

Is there a connection between the two in your personal experience? #TDII | 14 | That sounds like a good strategy 10353! I wouldn't be too worried about the health effects of chewing straws :) Keeping hands and mouth busy by using alternatives is something many people do when they try to quit or reduce smoking. Some other ideas you could try just for fun: Keep your hands busy: Use a stress ball, play a game on your phone, play with a Rubikâ€™s cube, start a fun arts and crafts project. Keep your mouth busy: Use gum, hard candy, mints, chew on toothpicks, prepare healthy snacks like veggie sticks, drink plenty of water. | 2015-08-19T23:47:56+0000

Baldness runs in my family, and my brother's hair was already thinking before he started smoking. My boyfriend shaves his head anyway, so it wouldn't make much of a difference to me there either. | 2015-08-18T19:20:25+0000

Because of the amount of upkeep and time it takes to set up, people use it as a treat if you wanna call it that. Cant take your hookah to work and smoke it lmao. | 2015-08-15T19:51:39+0000

Why do you think hookah has held on to a "cool" reputation even though it's just as unhealthy as other forms of tobacco use? #beingconscious | 3 | Exactly, it's a once in a while thing, with even more connotations than cigarettes as a social thing. Even though smoking hookah for one hour is like 200 cigarettes, the average smoker will smoke easily over 200 cigarettes before someone who only smokes hookah does it again. It's the infrequency that makes it seem healthier. | 2015-08-15T20:32:27+0000

I feel like smoking a hookah is a more intimate social activity too. You can smoke a cigarette with anyone, but I feel like you would only invite people who you're really close with to share a hookah with you. | 2015-08-18T19:17:20+0000

If you and your spouse are trying to have a baby and you don't get pregnant the first time- would you stop having sex? And say "oh well- wasnt meant to be." No! If you are looking for a job and get turned down by the first place you apply, do you stop putting in applications and going to interviews? NO! This is an absurd question that I don't think it's based in any type of reality. | 2015-08-14T20:55:04+0000

When I was a young'n my best friends parents had like one of the first e-cigarettes. We thought it was the coolest shit ever!!! We played with them, and even puffed on them... Even though we were maybe.... 10-11 years old. I absolutely see the appeal for young people as - and especially in this day and age- we are all about the next best thing! Bigger! Shinier! More electronically driven than ever, our society has almost everything driven toward- new and more advanced than ever! Conversely, at the time even I know what it was... I knew it was still just like smoking a cigarette. The thought never crossed my mind "oh yeah! This is much 'safer' than smoking a paper cigarette!" No I wasn't an idiot... Can I say the same for the you see generations?  no. | 2015-08-12T19:08:14+0000

It is decently odorless so nobody would ever guess it is nicotine and they can smoke them just about anywhere. Minors do not care about health hazzards. | 2015-08-12T19:19:08+0000

I like to think that the public is smart enough to understand that smoking anything is bad for your health; since that isn't the actual case, I fully support the legislation that markets cigarettes for what they really are instead of sugar coating things. I completely agree with calling "light" or "natural" cigarettes a different name in order to squash the misconceptions. | 2015-08-09T19:48:24+0000

Another part of the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (signed into law by President Obama in '09) prevents tobacco companies from making health claims about any supposed â€œreduced riskâ€? of any of their products that might encourage new smokers or discourage smokers from quitting. Do you think this is fair? #socialreflection | 5 | I also second that last part ^ because stating its light isnt saying how harmful it is. Its information on the product. | 2015-08-09T20:42:12+0000

Read this article to find out more about how under-aged kids are responding to the new e-cigs craze. #ecig | 1 | Honestly, probably cigarettes. Cigarette smoking often comes from having parents or other influential people in one's life who smoke, and I think that those sorts are generally ones who have tried to quit using e cigs, but weren't able to and thus stick to cigarettes. Of course it all boils down to a case by case basis regardless. | 2015-08-06T19:15:15+0000

For some rebellious rich bitch kids I think the next newest shiniest gadget. For those other kids who like 10374 said come from smoking households cigarettes for sure.

I doubt that underage kids would have the funds to buy the set ups for the ecigs and the juices to refill them with, and they certainly wouldn't want to keep up with the maintenance. In addition to that, if you aren't supposed to be smoking, it's a lot harder to hide those bulky vaporizers than it is to stash paper cigarettes. | 2015-08-06T21:35:46+0000

I personally think that's silly, because as mentioned above, people are still going to smoke. Besides, you can buy products like Tasty Puff that will let you flavor your cigarettes anyway. | 2015-08-03T02:01:00+0000

I assume it's to deter kids from smoking, but even if you flavor a cigarette it still tastes like cigarette, which kids do not like. | 2015-08-04T19:53:39+0000

What would you try? #beingconscious | 3 | If I wanted support I absolutely could get it- however throughout my whole life living independently... I've never yearned for support from others. I don't need it and I don't particularly want it... It makes me feel ashamed when people say they are proud of me... I'm not sure what psychological issue that stems from but... I've never liked it.  If and when I want to quit I will. And it will be a decision I make when I'm ready and I'll do it, I honestly probably won't tell anyone until they offer me a cigarette out of habit seeing I'm not lighting up. | 2015-08-03T19:05:52+0000

How can we help Fifi stop smoking? #smokingaffectsall | 8 | 10374 interesting point! thank you for being honest and sharing, although what do you mean propaganda oriented? This question is intended to make you think about the other living organisms- humans, animals, etc. that are affected, and more or less, unintentionally harmed by your smoking habits. Before creating this post, I had no idea cats were affected by the toxins made by smoke! So, I hope this post at least created awareness, and everyone learned something knew about the affect their smoking habits may have on others! | 2015-07-27T19:24:47+0000

I attempt to avoid exposing them to second hand smoke, but I don't force them away in doing so. The only real difference is that if an animal insists on being present while I'm smoking, I stop smoking, as they are generally perceived as being incapable of understanding the hazards. | 2015-07-29T19:40:39+0000

Besides the litter and second-hand smoke, I agree. | 2015-07-26T19:11:28+0000

Can you think of any other environmental improvements that might result from less smoke? #beingconscious | 3 | I very strongly have to disagree with aaalllll of this. Haha minutes maaaybe the house fires... But that's only if you smoke inside.... I feel like not many people do that anymore.  And if you do its your own damn fault and you're stupid. And on the side of the environment? Really?  your joking right? You think the smoke from CIGARETTES has a significant impact on the environment? Ha haha you're joking right? Compared to the hundreds of thousands of jet, car and coal emissions we pump into the air. Smoking is such a drop in the ocean on this issue.  However I do like 10347's idea... That would be an interesting  work around to have the seeds not be affected by the smoke being pulled through the  filter... Hmmmm.... | 2015-07-26T19:35:38+0000

But switching to another, more socially-acceptable way of ingesting nicotine wonâ€™t help you conquer your addiction. What would you rather do, take the easy way and switch to e-cigs, staying addicted and making these e-cig companies more money, or quit once and for all to live free of any level of nicotine-addiction?

People will quit when they are ready, and if they don't- well we all die in the end. Smokers and non smokers.  Morbid, I know but. #sorryboutit | 2015-07-20T19:16:26+0000

But unless all children are raised under rocks, they're going to see it eventually... So really... What's the hope here? That your children will never see big tobacco adverts? Tsk tsk tsk... Idiots.

Advertisments about smoking around a childrens area is wrong. Advertisements should be put where the people who need to see them do, not where its convenient.

10353 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What is currently your biggest smoking trigger? #TDII | 2 | It's a toss up between stress and riding in a car. Stress is obvious; but whenever I get in a car I feel like I have to smoke, even if I'm only driving for like 2 minutes. | 2015-07-23T00:02:42+0000

10336 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What is currently your biggest smoking trigger? #TDII | 4 | Nine times out of ten its because I have to bite my tongue when I don't want to. | 2015-07-23T00:04:14+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment | 10353  | #TDII |  | What is currently your biggest smoking trigger? #TDII | 5 | Hi 10353, so stress for you as well and your car - that's also a very common one. Have any of you guys ever experimented with things you can do to reduce the stress without actually smoking a cigarette? | 2015-07-23T00:06:14+0000
10353 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What is currently your biggest smoking trigger? #TDII | 6 | Smoke pot or drink a beer. Neither are viable options. Haha. Sometimes I hang out with my pets or just chill in a dark quiet room for a few minutes. Those both help a little. | 2015-07-23T00:08:08+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment | 10353 10336  | #TDII |  | What is currently your biggest smoking trigger? #TDII | 7 | Yeah, pot or a drink don't sound like the right strategies while driving. Have any of you guys ever tried deep breathing exercises for stress reduction? 10336 10353 | 2015-07-23T00:11:26+0000
10353 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What is currently your biggest smoking trigger? #TDII | 8 | I have maybe a total of 3 times. Maybe I was doing something wrong, but they didn't do much for me. | 2015-07-23T00:12:49+0000

10353 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What is currently your biggest smoking trigger? #TDII | 11 | Yeah, that sounds like it might work. I might give it a shot sometime. | 2015-07-23T00:19:26+0000
10336 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What is currently your biggest smoking trigger? #TDII | 12 | I'll attempt but I doubt it. I like smoking. | 2015-07-23T00:20:44+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment | 10336  | #TDII |  | What is currently your biggest smoking trigger? #TDII | 13 | 10336 - sure give it a try. Experiments can be helpful because they can sometimes help us to realize we could get through a trigger without smoking when we didn't think we could. I urge everyone to try some type of experiment this week if you can. | 2015-07-23T00:25:35+0000

10374 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What do you guys like about smoking? #TDII | 2 | Also, it's almost a watered down sort of necrophilia, each drag a kiss with death, approaching the veil without crossing. Like an adrenaline junkies death-defying rush, but much slower, more sensual. | 2015-07-15T23:03:13+0000

10349 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What do you guys like about smoking? #TDII | 4 | I don't. Smoking is a nasty terrible habit that gives you bad breath and smelly hands. Like I said on a post a while ago- it's a habitual thing now. | 2015-07-15T23:07:20+0000

10374 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What do you guys like about smoking? #TDII | 11 | It's sort of based on the idea of pain reminding us we're alive. So when I cough, or imagine I can feel the toxins in my skin, it helps to remind me that I can die, which gives me a morbid sort of comfort. I'm not very good at staying "grounded" so to speak, and that sort of thinking helps me to stay in touch with what's around me. | 2015-07-15T23:29:24+0000

Do you honestly expect people to research what the hell they put into their bodies? People always look for a "quick fix" and don't want to take the time or effort to actually find out what is really happening or take the time to fix/resolve something. Why do you think we are so complacent with products that is in our food now-a-days? We are fed this propaganda bullshit from the media telling us its "healthy" or  "see results 3 times as fast!"

I'll live in whatever way suits me in the moment, and I'm excited to see the culmination of all my desicions, good and bad, when I die. I don't put much value into material objects, nor the money that buys them. Giving it to big tobacco is more of a grey area.

However, what we know from studies with thousands of people is that on average a smoker looses 10 years of their life. Check out this study if you're interested to learn more http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa1211128 What do you think about this? | 2015-07-09T00:36:07+0000

As long as the 'if they want to' qualifier is retained I don't see the harm, but at the same time, I feel that harm is perspective. If there were such thing as someone who truly lived a happier, more fulfilling, (though likely shorter) life because of smoking, is it still harm to the individual? | 2015-07-09T00:50:40+0000

No offense but until someone shows me a step by step study done that shows smoking caused someone's death- I won't be convinced. | 2015-07-09T00:51:38+0000

Does that change how you feel about smoking and quitting? #TDII | 22 | 10349, there is absolutely no doubt that smoking causes these deaths, and even internal tobacco industry documents reveal that they have know this for decades. I can find more studies if you're interested. | 2015-07-09T01:00:13+0000

Does that change how you feel about smoking and quitting? #TDII | 23 | I think it's highly presumptuous to outright say smoking causes these deaths. Not to say it does not aid in quickening the process, although that's debatable as well- however smoking does not and did not cause any of these people to die in the study you presented to me.  Death is an inevitable part of life- am I wrong doc? You saying smoking CAUSED the deaths of the participants in the study, says in latent terms, if these participants didn't or would not have smoked they would not die. | 2015-07-09T01:05:43+0000

Does that change how you feel about smoking and quitting? #TDII | 24 | Well of course we are talking about risk and not every person is the same. Two people could smoke exactly the same number of cigs in their life and one person may die from it and the other still lives. So yes, in this kind of study design we can't say anything more than that. A study to prove that smoking causes death in humans would be an experiment where you have identical twins in the exact same environment, give cigs to one person and no cigs to the other and see what happens. Such a study is obviously not ethical so we can't do it. However, from animal studies and studies on cells we know that constituents of tobacco smoke CAUSE cancer. And the data we have from studies with humans absolutely support this hypothesis. There simply is no other reasonable explanation for so many deaths in smokers. Of course what you believe is up to you. I'm just trying to give you the most comprehensive information. | 2015-07-09T01:13:23+0000

What would make quitting even more important to you? #motivation | 4 | It's not a big deal to me. It's just smoking. Ha I say that yet "just smoking" has aided in many cases of lung cancer and other horrific diseases  yet. It's not something I really care about- smoking to me can go either way- take it or leave it.  What would change that? Children. Always children. | 2015-07-05T19:08:02+0000

10374 | Participant | TSP daily post response comment |  | #motivation | 10 | 10. What is keeping quitting smoking from the top of your priorities list? What would make quitting even more important to you? #motivation | 8 | I feel that this is a difficult question, because while I can't speak for others, for me quitting is mostly neutral on the spectrum of desire. For some, it's outright undesirable, so asking what would make it more of a priority is like asking someone what would make stubbing their toe or jumping up and down more of a priority. It's already either inconsequential or undesirable, so barring extreme circumstance, not much would make us want it. Again, I only speak for myself though. | 2015-07-05T22:20:08+0000

I guess after my best friends brother committed suicide, she picked it up- be it the nature of rebellion after a tragedy, or nurture that both her parents smoke. And by sheer time spent with her I picked it up too. I don't blame her by any means, but she did smoke my first, second, third fourth fifth... And so on cigarettes with me. I guess I felt I was helping her by joining in? Odd I know... oh and this was when I was 12. I'm now 22, so 10 years ago. | 2015-06-30T14:16:51+0000

Who helped you? #motivation | 3 | Similar to 10347, becoming a manager at a young age- being the youngest manager of a swimming complex... It took 7 years of hard work, dedication and lots of sunburns. Lots of trial and error- but with the help of my mentors and small knit group of friends and coworkers, persistence paid off. I was a manager for 2 years before I left that job. From that experience I learned working hard and having a goal- with time, blood sweat and tears you can reach and even supersede your goals. (ClichÃ© I know but - eh)  | 2015-06-26T20:01:50+0000

Its been an uphill battle, but my boyfriend, friends, and family have offered me support along the way. They keep me going. (: | 2015-06-29T21:07:53+0000

10349 | Participant | TSP daily post response comment |  | #motivation | 3 | 3. How would you support someone who tells you they want to quit smoking? #motivation | 1 | How? A- never offer them a smoke. What an asshole move. B- don't smoke around them, not for a while anyway, what an awful temptation for someone trying to kick it.  C-offer any help or support I can for them. | 2015-06-28T20:04:55+0000
10336 | Participant | TSP daily post response comment |  | #motivation | 3 | 3.

10353 | Participant | TSP daily post response comment |  | #motivation | 3 | 3. How would you support someone who tells you they want to quit smoking? #motivation | 6 | I would just offer as much moral support as possible. I would probably ask if it was okay to smoke around them, but I would at least try to be courteous about it. | 2015-06-29T17:15:24+0000
10358 | Participant | TSP daily post response comment |  | #motivation | 3 | 3. How would you support someone who tells you they want to quit smoking? #motivation | 7 | I try to not smoke around them and encourage them. | 2015-06-30T18:30:41+0000
10374 | Participant | TSP daily post response comment |  | #motivation | 3 | 3. How would you support someone who tells you they want to quit smoking? #motivation | 8 | Ask them, when they are in the quitting mindset, rather than the craving mindset, exactly how I can help, how they'd like me to behave around them in regards to smoking, and ensure they know that they can ask me to change that behavior around them at any time. If they want me to stop them, or just not give them smokes, I will hold them to it. Everybody's struggle is different, and it's important to work with someone rather than make assumption on what will work for them. | 2015-07-01T08:25:52+0000

100005594500096 | Tsp Study | TSP other post |  | n/a |  | This group is for 18-25 year olds who smoke that want to learn more information about tobacco, how it affects your body, and the different quitting options available. Once you get more information about smoking and connect with other young adults who are in the same boat, you can decide if you want to make a change. Getting educated is the first step to making the right decision for YOU. This group has been randomly selected to have Monthly Incentives; you can accumulate $30 at the end of every month in which you comment every day, for a gift card of up to $90 at the end of the session. | 0 | n/a | 2014-10-14T05:21:52+0000
