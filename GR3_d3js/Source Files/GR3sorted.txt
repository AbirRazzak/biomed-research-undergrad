If you put down 10 for yesterday's post, why is quitting so important to you and how did it get to the top of your priorities list? #motivation | 4 | Smoking long term isn't worth it. Learning to quit would be helpful in how to deal with addiction & temptation. It is literally one of the most irrational acts for one's health. It's like living a paradox, knowing its like a lottery for all sorts of health problems, but being aware of the facts sometimes just doesn't seem important. | 2015-02-03T21:09:37+0000

I don't smoke as much but all these cravings make it that much harder. I wouldn't feel bad if I weren't pregnant cause I know quitting is a process but I feel so guilty not being able to stop right now.

A high score on Health suggests that the hazards of smoking may be enough to make you want to quit now. A high score on Example suggests you want to set a good example for others.
