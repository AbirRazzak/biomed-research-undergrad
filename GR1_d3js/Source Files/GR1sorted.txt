I probably 'quit' about 10-15 times before it has actually stuck. And you'll have cravings still and just have to accept that. My mom hasn't smoked for about 5 years and she says she still gets cravings every now and then. | 2015-02-19T20:51:55+0000

Cravings usually get a lot better/less intense after the first 5 min - so hang in there! Maybe you could keep a playlist with your favorite tunes on your phone/iPod to listen to when the craving hits. Do you have a good friend to call as an emergency contact? | 2015-01-22T01:25:29+0000

Alcohol isn't too bad anymore, unless I'm just a little tipsy. And watching movies with people smoking. I watched The Help last week and it's the strongest I've wanted a cigarette in awhile.

On your quit day, you have to remember to take things one day at a time. How will you remind yourself that slow and steady wins the race? #reinforcement | 2 | I just need to remind myself not to get ahead of the game. And deal with things as they come and not deal with them Ahead of time | n/a

But I need your help.If I'm feeling that way should I start using the patches and gum sooner. Or should I wait?I'm going to a house with 2 heavy smokers and another house with another heavy smoker.And I'm not sure if I should wait or start sooner? | 2014-12-18T01:07:09+0000

Still feeling committed to staying smoke free? #TDII | 2 | HI 10001 - that sounds like a difficult situation and I can see why that can stress you out. In general I would recommend you quit while we are still running this group, since there is an entire support system in place for you. Is there any chance you can ask the smokers you are going to move in with to support you in your efforts? (hint: assertiveness) If you think that's not an option moving the quit date back is of course ok as well. You know yourself and your situation better than I ever will - so in the end it's your decision. | 2014-12-18T01:13:35+0000

You can take off the patch during the night if that causes you trouble sleeping. That's perfectly fine. | 2014-12-18T01:15:41+0000

Still feeling committed to staying smoke free? #TDII | 5 | You know chances are there will always be some smokers in your life. So I guess you could postpone your quitting endlessly. Eventually you will have to face other smokers after you have quit. I'm not saying that will be easy, but I think it will probably be somewhat inevitable in the long run.

What didn't work was buying a pack when I caved then giving it to my roommate for 'emergencies.' Slowly getting off them worked so the amount of nicotine that I was putting in my body was getting less and less (that took a very long period of time). | 2014-12-14T23:24:05+0000

They have an off taste.And didn't feel anything like a cigarette to me. So it was much weirder useing that tbh. I'll try the nrts over the ecigs anyway. | 2014-12-14T04:42:20+0000

Why or why not? #beingconscious http://www.webmd.com/smoking-cessation/quit-smoking | 1 | I've been doing cold turkey and so far so good. In the past I tried slowly quitting, and lowering my cigarettes each day. Worked for a little bit but if I knew I had a pack I would take the cigarettes. Ive always tried cold turkey about 10 times before and this is the 2nd longest I've gone without smoking (not even 1!). I've thought about hypnosis before, as well, because that's how my uncle quit but never get around to it. And I felt I didn't smoke enough to need nicotine replacement like patches or gum. It's really hard, though, when your favorite TV shows have heavy smokers in it (Boardwalk Empire for example) and then all of sudden just start craving one like crazy. In those times I think nicotine replacements would help BUT then I'm still putting the nicotine in my body. | 2014-12-03T04:29:27+0000

If I see it everytime I get in the car it'll definitely help, plus you have to get in the car to go by the pack and if I see the reasons of why I want to quit looking back at me before I potentially buy a pack it'll remind me why I want to do it and why I need to stay strong.

Let me know if you have any questions! | 2 | Great question 10001! I would definitely recommend to get something that helps you deal with withdrawal, nicotine replacement therapy, for example gum or patch. You should also ask friends and family if they can support your quitting! I think social support is crucial! How do these sound? Are there any other options you have already thought about? | 2014-11-27T01:19:22+0000

Let me know if you have any questions! | 4 | I like the sounds of a patch or gum. But I don't know how expensive they can be. I heard the prices are off the wall and am not sure where to get them. I'd ask my doctor but I don't have medical.And I have plenty of support Johannes Thrul :). I just break down and have a cigarette when it comes to be the second week. | 2014-11-27T01:29:15+0000

Let me know if you have any questions! | 5 | 10017, good observation. Actually both of the reasons you mentioned contribute to the weight gain some people experience after quitting. Smoking acts as an appetite suppressant and may slightly increase yourmetabolism as well. When you quit smoking, your appetite and metabolism return to normal — which may lead you to eat more and burn fewer calories. Also, your ability to smell and taste food improves after you quitsmoking. This can make food more appealing, which may lead you to eat more. And if you substitute snacking for smoking, the calories may quickly add up. Weight gain, however, is not inevitable after quitting. There are plenty of options for healthy, low calorie snacks, you can make wise food choices, and start to get more exercise. All of these will counter a potential weight gain. | 2014-11-27T01:31:30+0000

(I've been soing meal prep for about 2 months now, working out 3 weeks). I feel like I should be seeing SOME weight loss, even if it's just a little but I'm not. Could that be because of metabolism slowing down even though I eat healthy ? | 2014-11-27T01:33:39+0000

If you were a minor, do you think an e-cig would be more appealing and “safer? to try than a traditional cigarette? #ecig | 1 | I think when young people TRY cigarettes, they aren't looking for a 'safer' alternative, they know cigarettes aren't safe already and want to try it to look 'cool and dangerous.' BUT e cigs are also a trend that is happening right now, which is why I think minors would be wanting to try them. They always want what's in the current trend and if they see their older siblings using an e cig, then they'll want to use the e cig. The appeal, in my opinion, is that you won't have the cigarette smell on you like regular cigarettes so they would be able to use these more inconspicuously. | 2014-11-26T00:16:18+0000

First week I didn't go out with friends to bars because it would've been too much. I've been around other smokers and just went inside. I've been rewarding myself for not smoking (such as new workout clothes and a pedicure) and I've been working out regularly and eating healthy. Cravings still come, sometimes very strong, but when I get the urge I try to distract myself from that feeling. | 2014-12-05T00:33:00+0000

You are doing a great job! Cravings can be among the most difficult things to overcome and it may take a while until you are rid of them for good.
