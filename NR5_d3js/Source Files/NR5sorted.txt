I can't even imagine why they would stop selling packs fewer than 20, but the free samples may be because of new smokers wanting to try them.

What do you think about tobacco companies targeting young people through the media? #beingconscious | 2 | Smoking is a thing some people do and children will see it whether or not they see it in a film. By making it seem horrendous and making a huge deal, that brings an interest to kids. I probably would have never experimented with certain drugs and other things if my parents didn't make it seem like such a taboo and rebellious thing. | 2015-07-13T20:30:06+0000

What recent changes to tobacco laws in your community are making it harder for you to smoke? Do you think these new laws protect more people than they inconvenience? #socialreflection | 2 | My state is raising the price of cigarettes over the next three years by $0.76. This increase is not a tax. It is going to the retailers under the category of 'the cost of doing business'. This is expected to make a 2.24 percent decrease in cigarette sales. A survey from 2013 pegged TN with the 9th highest smoking rate and our neighbor, KY, as number 1. I think this new law is good for the retailers and smokers in my state because around 23% of the state are smokers and in my opinion that is a high percentage. An even scarier statistic is that of the kids in grades 9-12, about 21% are smokers. I may not be happy about paying more but I was one of those kids a few years back. I think that it should be reduced. | 2015-07-09T02:54:26+0000

Because the most fun thing to do in the world is go out in the freezing cold in winter to have a smoke, right? No. It actually sucks and makes the cigarettes taste worse, in my opinion. | 2015-07-05T20:28:00+0000

But it's something I enjoy. It's my social activity with my girlfriend lmao. She's wanting to quit too so I may encourage her to try with me. | 2015-06-25T00:44:44+0000

Trying to quit with someone else can really help because it creates accountability and you are in it together and can support each other. I encourage you to talk to her to see if she's interested. There may also be other fun activities you can share with her other than smoking :) And you'll have more money to spend on other things that are fun, and less money into Big Tobacco's pockets. | 2015-06-25T00:49:12+0000

How would work or school be different if you didnâ€™t smoke? #beingconscious | 3 | I'm not allowed to smoke while at work. We don't get breaks either so there is no chance of smoking. Also the last time I was sick was because I was pregnant and got an upper respiratory infection from my father in law. I got the good end of the stick because my son got the flu and because I got sick, I found out I was pregnant. | 2015-06-24T22:03:32+0000

They can burn you, they create messes if you spill the ash tray, the butts can be a major choking hazard, along with disgusting and extremely unhealthy for you to swallow, and countless other things you have to teach children about. | 2015-06-22T21:43:28+0000

The only real success stories I've heard are of people quitting cold turkey. I've used the gum before, but it wasn't too quit smoking. It was for the v environments where I wasn't allowed to smoke for long periods of time. | 2015-06-22T13:30:26+0000

He's lost his hair, energy, weight, etc. My great aunt, his wife, had breast cancer. My grandma (dad's mom), however, is dying from state four lung cancer. The crazy part is, she's been smoking since she was 14, but the doctors told her that oddly enough, it is not caused by the smoking. I can't remember the cause, I think growing up her family were miners or something. She still smokes. | 2015-05-15T20:22:13+0000

Do you approve this portion of the Act? What do you think? #socialreflection | 2 | Yes because I know I don't want my son, who may be 5 at that time, to see a cigarette ad and think that it's okay. They don't know that it's very illegal and not safe at that age. They may think it's something to eat and see one and try to eat it. | 2015-05-20T21:54:22+0000

Do you approve this portion of the Act? What do you think? #socialreflection | 3 | Sure! Some children and adults have horrible asthma or other breathing issues that might be set off by just a small bit of smoke blowing their way. I always try to not smoke near people that I'm not sure smoke themselves, for that reason. Also, some people just despise the smell. It's a respect thing for me. | 2015-05-20T21:56:12+0000

10206 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What do you guys like about smoking? #TDII | 2 | The relief I get from it in the mornings. | 2015-05-14T00:11:51+0000

1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment | 10206  | #TDII |  | What do you guys like about smoking? #TDII | 4 | Same question for you 10206 - any things you dislike about smoking? And if so what are they? | 2015-05-14T00:13:00+0000
10206 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What do you guys like about smoking? #TDII | 5 | Coughing, runny nose. Maybe a little shortness of breath. But the relief I get from it far outweighs those thing. | 2015-05-14T00:15:09+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What do you guys like about smoking? #TDII | 6 | So other than the relief you get in the morning, are there any more positive things you can think of? | 2015-05-14T00:17:05+0000

10206 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What do you guys like about smoking? #TDII | 9 | Kind of a go-to when I'm angry or sad. | 2015-05-14T00:19:59+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What do you guys like about smoking? #TDII | 10 | Ok, guys - thanks for sharing all of this. Let me ask you: What would have to happen in your life to make smoking less appealing and quitting more appealing? | 2015-05-14T00:24:56+0000
10206 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What do you guys like about smoking? #TDII | 11 | A lethal disease as a result thereof. | 2015-05-14T00:29:02+0000
10220 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What do you guys like about smoking? #TDII | 12 | Knowing there would be no withdrawal or negative things I'd have to go through to quit and not want anymore. | 2015-05-14T00:31:51+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment | 10206  | #TDII |  | What do you guys like about smoking? #TDII | 13 | 10206 and as long as you don't have a lethal disease there is no reason for you to even think about quitting. Does that capture it? | 2015-05-14T00:32:49+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment | 10220  | #TDII |  | What do you guys like about smoking? #TDII | 14 | 10220 so if quitting was easy and no problem at all, you would be willing to think about it. What else could increase your motivation to consider quitting/reducing smoking? | 2015-05-14T00:37:11+0000
10206 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What do you guys like about smoking? #TDII | 15 | Right. I love smoking. | 2015-05-14T00:37:42+0000
10220 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What do you guys like about smoking? #TDII | 16 | If my daughter showed signs of asthma like her bio father has, but even then I'd probably just keep her from it or something unless it was horrible asthma, if that makes sense. | 2015-05-14T00:47:30+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment | 10206  | #TDII |  | What do you guys like about smoking? #TDII | 17 | 10206 fair enough. It's really up to you and no one can force you to do something you don't want to. You may still find the information we are providing here useful, if you change your mind at one point. And I am always happy to discuss all different kinds of positions on smoking :) | 2015-05-14T00:50:44+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment | 10220  | #TDII |  | What do you guys like about smoking? #TDII | 18 | 10220 how does your smoking affect your daughter, if it does at all? | 2015-05-14T00:51:33+0000
10206 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What do you guys like about smoking? #TDII | 19 | I have a question. Is it true that nicotine in large amounts is a hallucinogen? | 2015-05-14T00:52:52+0000
10220 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What do you guys like about smoking? #TDII | 20 | I don't really think it does unless it happens to go in her eyes. She has been getting into my packs lately, trying to mimic mommy. She asked me the other day if she could have one. I'm debating the idea whether or not I should let her take a drag, cough her lungs out, and be done with it. | 2015-05-14T00:53:49+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment | 10206  | #TDII |  | What do you guys like about smoking? #TDII | 21 | 10206, not sure really - that 's the first time I hear about it. There is some evidence though that hallucinogens may be useful for smoking cessation.

1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment | 10220  | #TDII |  | What do you guys like about smoking? #TDII | 22 | 10220 I would not recommend you letting your daughter have a drag from your cigarette. If you don't want her to smoke, I suggest you tell her that. Do you think her showing interest in smoking may be due to the fact that she sees her mom do it? | 2015-05-14T01:00:09+0000
10206 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What do you guys like about smoking? #TDII | 23 | Hm. Interesting. I know Aztec did tobacco enemas for the hallucinogenic properties. | 2015-05-14T01:04:54+0000
10220 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | What do you guys like about smoking? #TDII | 24 | Probably. She wants to be where I am and doing what I'm doing at all times. | 2015-05-14T01:06:01+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment | 10220  | #TDII |  | What do you guys like about smoking? #TDII | 25 | 10220 - if you don't want your daughter to start smoking, you can do a lot by setting a good example (like not letting her see you smoking if you don't want to quit) and giving her clear rules that you don't want her to smoke when you are around and in the house etc. The best way to prevent your children from smoking is to not smoke yourself. The younger your children are when you quit, the less likely they are to become smokers themselves. What you do is of course your decision, I just want to give you my honest advice and as much information as possible, so you can make an informed decision what's right for you and your family. | 2015-05-14T01:13:48+0000

1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment | 10209  | #TDII |  | Do you think you will EVER be ready to quit smoking? Why? Why not? #TDII | 1 | Hi 10209 - great to hear that you are thinking about cutting back on your smoking. I am going to address your comment right here if you don't mind. I have a couple of recommendation that you could try to gradually reduce the number of cigarettes you smoke: Pick certain cigarettes you want to eliminate (e.g. the first or last one each day, a cigarette after a meal), you could also think about declaring smoke free zones to get you to smoke less (e.g. stop smoking in your car). Yet another way would be to gradually increase the time interval between cigarettes. What do you think about these suggestions? Anything sound like it may work for you? | 2015-05-07T00:20:46+0000
10209 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | Do you think you will EVER be ready to quit smoking? Why? Why not? #TDII | 2 | Im not sure but I know I'd like to try both.

Why not? #TDII | 3 | Great 10209 - I think you're off to a great start! If full on quitting is nothing you want to do right now, I definitely recommend you try to reduce your smoking. What do you think would be your high risk situations? I.E. the situations where it would be hardest for you to not smoke? | 2015-05-07T00:29:16+0000

How does smoking fit (or not fit) with that image of you? #balance | 1 | I'm very self-aware and can spot my own drawbacks well. I'm also an extrovert and have to be around people a lot. I really have no idea how smoking fits in with that. | 2015-04-25T19:03:23+0000

How does smoking fit (or not fit) with that image of you? #balance | 2 | I am a very compassionate person. Always have a heart to help others. For example, I'm searching for an organization that will take a huge box of my daughters old clothes to a third world country for little girls there. I'm also very friendly. I think some people see me smoking and automatically think I'm trashy, etc. My family doesn't know I smoke. Only my customers (work at a popular convenience store) and my friends do, really. I'm kinda ashamed I guess but only because I know people are mostly close minded and have stereotypes already in their heads. | 2015-04-26T02:18:37+0000

10220 | Participant | TSP daily post response comment |  | #motivation | 1 | #1: Share a success that you have had in the past. It can be anything from any time. Why did it work? Who helped you? #motivation | 1 | I always hated school. It was a boring routine of immature and annoying classmates, standardized tests, fake friends, and some bad teachers. At the end of my sophomore year, I learned that there was a three year graduate program and decided to jump on it. This would mean that the next year, I'd be taking both junior and senior classes, and during the second semester, evening night classes at the college for dual credit. The counselor and my parents didn't think I could handle it emotionally (I have severe anxiety and depression problems, along with adult ADD) but I felt that being in school even longer would make my problems worse. They all eventually supported me. The first semester was miserable. I had a full schedule, lots of hard classes, and had no friends because of summertime drama. September 2011, I smoked K2 before school. I had no idea what it was and seriously thought it was just a form of marijuana that was legal. One hit caused me to have a seizure on the school yard, be taken to the hospital by ambulance, get sent to the alternative school (first time ever being in trouble), and drop me from the top 10% of my new class of 2012. I was still on course to graduating early, though. Thank goodness, too. I found out I was pregnant January-February 2012. I quit my after school job so I could go to my night classes and spent all my graduation money on things my daughter would need. If I didn't have the support of my mom and step-dad, putting up with my horribly emotional pregnancy mood swings, my teachers allowing me to work on other classes homework, understanding my schedule, and my new girlfriend at the time, I don't know where I would be now. | 2015-04-24T19:10:45+0000

Let me know if you have any questions! #TDII | 1 | Hi 10209 - let me try to address your question right here: There is not really any right or wrong way, but certainly more or less effective ways. Nicotine replacement therapy can be a good help to reduce withdrawal symptoms, the rest is really about learning new habits and findings alternatives to smoking or distracting yourself. But the first thing in my experience is about motivation: How important is quitting smoking for you right now? | 2015-04-30T00:53:52+0000

Group of friends walked under a huge willow tree after school one day and a kid named Zane lit one and offered to let me try it. I had one hit and don't think I had another for a few years. I guess it was just to see what the big deal was, my friends were, and yeah. Lol | 2015-04-27T22:36:02+0000
