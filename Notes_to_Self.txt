This document is meant to keep notes to myself and/or any developer wishing to understand my code.

CHANGING THE COLOR SCALE:
I changed line 36 to schemeCategory10 from schemeCategory20 so that node group 2 may appear to be orange.
This will be useful when implementing centrality.
The new line of code now reads: var color = d3.scaleOrdinal(d3.schemeCategory10)

MAKING NODES DRAG-AND-DROP:
I commented out 2 lines of code from the dragended(d) function to make the nodes stay put when the user has ended the drag on the nodes.
This will be useful if the user decides to shape their network in a different way than originally initialized.
The lines of code for the function now reads:
function dragended(d) {
    if (!d3.event.active) simulation.alphaTarget(0);
    //d.fx = null;
    //d.fy = null;
}



var densityLabel = svg.append("text")
    .attr("x", 15)
    .attr("y", 25)
    .style("font-family", "sans-serif")
    .style("fill", "red")
    .style("font-size", "24px")
    .text("Density = ")
    .text("5");


 STAR Week 3
    - figured out how to display link values when hovering over (only applied to GR1)
    - displayed network density

STAR Week 4
  - Changed UI so all graphs are on 1 page
  - displayed the link values when hovering on all graphs
