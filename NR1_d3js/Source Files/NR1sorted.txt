10010 | Participant | TSP other post response comment |  | #ecig |  | Many people donâ€™t like to label themselves as a â€œsmokerâ€?. The fact remains that switching to an e-cig does not mean youâ€™ve stopped ingesting addictive and harmful chemicals.

1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | Hi guys, what is currently your biggest smoking trigger? #TDII | 4 | I agree, especially when you try to quit smoking it may initially be a good idea to reduce your alcohol use as well, as this tends to lead to high risk situations for relapse. After eating you may want to consider just brushing your teeth, using some sugar free gum or hard candy, or simply a toothpick in your mouth to distract yourself from smoking.

Did you have to face any specific cravings or smoking triggers? | 4 | 10010 exercise is a great way to reduce your stress. I can also recommend a couple of simple techniques for relieving stress, like visualization and imagery or deep relaxation. Have you ever tried stress reduction techniques? | 2014-12-04T01:14:52+0000

Did you have to face any specific cravings or smoking triggers? | 8 | 10010, one option is imagery - Imagery means picturing or imagining something in your mind. Find somewhere quiet where you can be alone. Visualize a scene that makes you feel more relaxed. Then, focus on your senses (what do you see? Hear? Smell? Taste? Feel against your skin?) | 2014-12-04T01:39:19+0000

100005594500096 | Tsp Study | TSP other post |  | n/a |  | This group is for 18-25 year olds who smoke that want to learn more information about tobacco, how it affects your body, and the different quitting options available. Once you get more information about smoking and connect with other young adults who are in the same boat, you can decide if you want to make a change. Getting educated is the first step to making the right decision for YOU. This group has been randomly selected to have Daily Incentives; you can accumulate $1 at the end of every day that you comment, for a gift card of up to $90 at the end of the session. | 0 | n/a | 2014-10-14T05:18:45+0000
