We're building a life together and smoking is not something we really should spend money on. | 2015-09-16T19:04:02+0000

Do you think the fans at these events will miss their favorite Tobacco brands at their game or show? #socialreflection | 2 | Highly unlikely. It's very unlikely that anyone will even remember the advertisements from the event. Advertisements at these sorts of events are almost entirely psychological. such as Sprite at a basketball game. When you eventually get thirsty, Sprite is likely to be the last beverage you saw and in turn will up the chance that you will order a Sprite. | 2015-09-13T20:17:33+0000

What have you heard about NRTâ€™s? Would you consider using them? #beingconscious | 1 | I don't see how counseling helps except maybe for stress management. Also, I take Bupropion SR. It's one generic form of Welbutrin. Never helped me quit or made me want to smoke less.As for NRTs, when you use them you are simply breaking the hand to mouth habit, not the nicotine habit. | 2015-09-11T19:05:18+0000

How would work or school be different if you didnâ€™t smoke? #beingconscious | 1 | I actually don't get sick more than once a year. Twice if I'm really stressed out during cold and flu season. And even then I love by the mantra "pop a pill and go." If someone in my house is sick I take extra immune boosters. I dont have time to get sick and its really easy not to get sick. | 2015-09-14T19:02:23+0000

I started smoking at thirteen. The only thing I was ever worried about was my mom finding my pack and smelling it on me. E-cigs don't smell and they're so much easier to hide. Minors aren't worried about their health. | 2015-08-31T19:26:38+0000

Do you think this is fair? #socialreflection | 2 | Yes and no. Smoking is terrible for your health, it affects three major organ systems just off the top of my head. Prevention is key, and having strict guidelines for advertising is a big help. However, smoking doesn't kill; the diseases it causes do. There are mild carcinogens in just about everything at this point, from plastic to processed food, and while you hear about them in wild articles on Facebook that don't quite have all the facts right, they aren't widely known, and they should be talked about and advertised about just as much as tobacco products. | 2015-08-28T21:36:59+0000

My brother doesn't smoke. My attitudes mostly came from my childhood best friend's house down the block where her mom, who was a single mother, smoked. We got the opportunity to smoke when her mom was at work and we walked home from school together. | 2015-08-20T19:27:52+0000

Some days, (not very often but it happens) I wake up and I wheeze like I've been smoking for thirty years. Or some days my breathing is very shallow and weird, like I can't take a deep breath until I smoke a cigarette. But most days when I wake up, I feel great. | 2015-08-23T19:16:37+0000

Her name is Alice, she's a Norwegian Forest Cat, so she's huge. About the size of a medium sized dog. I always think about animals when I smoke in a place that has them, and I don't smoke in the same room as them.

But that's just something parents need to do with their kids. | 2015-08-15T19:03:41+0000

I'll quit before I have kids anyway. | 2015-08-15T20:10:06+0000

You'd have to cut out bbqing and campfires too before you even started an argument about cigarettes lol | 2015-08-14T19:02:06+0000

They're made with some sort of plastic. If less people smoked, there would be less filters on the ground. | 2015-08-14T20:36:59+0000

It also would probably do less damage to our ozone and environment. More so if they changed their fiber filters to REAL COTTON filters. | 2015-08-15T00:24:55+0000

10412 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | Do you think you will EVER be ready to quit smoking? Why? Why not? #TDII | 3 | I'd say a 2. Like a whisper in the back of the mind. | 2015-08-13T00:10:40+0000

If it comes to that it goes from the 2 to a 10. Until then, I'm not too worried. I highly doubt I'll get to that point before I actually quit on my own. | 2015-08-13T00:24:35+0000

What there should be within 1000' are billboards and outdoor advertising on the facts of smoking and drugs, not D.A.R.E. crap.

If I can't get away for a cigarette I just use that and after a few minutes I'm calmer and I can continue with a much better attitude! | 2015-08-06T00:40:57+0000

Keep your mouth busy: Use gum, hard candy, mints, chew on toothpicks, prepare healthy snacks like veggie sticks, drink plenty of water. Any of these sound useful? | 2015-08-06T00:54:48+0000

10430 | Participant | TSP daily post response comment |  | #motivation | 7 | #7: How would you react if you found out your son or daughter smoked cigarettes? #motivation | 2 | I'd hope that she'd be able to quit. Wouldn't want her to end up developing cancer | 2015-07-21T19:37:50+0000
10397 | Participant | TSP daily post response comment |  | #motivation | 7 | #7: How would you react if you found out your son or daughter smoked cigarettes? #motivation | 3 | It depends if I'm still smoking myself or not. My parents quit smoking before my brother and I realized that they smoked, to try to give us the best chance of not picking up the habit. When they found out I smoke, they were crushed and tried everything to make me quit until they gave up. Eventually I started to cut down on my own, now. So I would let them make their own decisions and hope that I raised then with enough sense to see that they don't want to drag this ball and chain around forever, either, and quit when they're ready. | 2015-07-21T20:28:32+0000
10428 | Participant | TSP daily post response comment |  | #motivation | 7 | #7: How would you react if you found out your son or daughter smoked cigarettes? #motivation | 4 | I would be upset. It also depends on how old they are at the time but I'm going to make sure I talk to my kids about how smoking is not cool and bad for your health and hopefully I quit before then | 2015-07-21T20:53:07+0000
10341 | Participant | TSP daily post response comment |  | #motivation | 7 | #7: How would you react if you found out your son or daughter smoked cigarettes? #motivation | 5 | I would be disappointed but I wouldn't be able to say much other than give advice based on experience because I started at a young age also, and kids learn a lot from their parents, so if I found out they were, I would have no one to blame but myself. | 2015-07-21T23:13:40+0000

Why do you think so many people who smoke are ready to adopt new products even before proper research on their safety has happened? #beingconscious | 1 | Because in society if it's new it's better. People automatically assume since its a vapor it's less harmless when the e ciggs are just as addictive and possibly even more harmful | 2015-08-03T19:03:12+0000

Why do you think so many people who smoke are ready to adopt new products even before proper research on their safety has happened? #beingconscious | 2 | I don't know, my my Dr actually said if you're going to smoke, smoke real ones. She had a bunch of patients get pneumonia who were using ecigs and vapes. As a health care provider she doesn't encourage smoking of course, but she'd rather me have real ones or use patches or gum than the ecigs. | 2015-08-03T19:04:34+0000

Why do you think so many people who smoke are ready to adopt new products even before proper research on their safety has happened? #beingconscious | 3 | I tried the e-cigarette thing, and it was super nice for a few days to not smell smoke all over me, since I don't smoke in my house. But they weren't as good. Smoking does stink, and the taste is something not many like, but we'll still do it. So might as well go with the nicer smelling and tasting option if you can. | 2015-08-03T19:09:45+0000

10419 | Participant | TDII response comment |  | #TDII |  | Have you ever tried to quit or reduce your smoking? Which strategy did you choose and how did it go? #TDII | 5 | The way i went about it was when i would have the urge to smoke i would put my headphones in and play music. I honestly would have been successful in quitting however i live with other smokers and being around that caused me to grab another cigarette. Yes i would recommend this method for others trying to quit However i would also probably tell them that they may want to try to not be around other smokers untill they are fully comfortable and confident that they have successfully quit smoking. :) | 2015-07-30T00:28:25+0000

And they scare me because my medicine usually works pretty well in situations but with her it bypasses and the thoughts begin. | 2015-07-23T01:05:34+0000
1548406165413991 | Johannes Thrul | TDII response comment | 10430  | #TDII |  | What is currently your biggest smoking trigger? #TDII | 4 | Yeah that does sound stressful and I can understand that you would be scared 10430. What else has worked for you in the past to stop or deal with these thoughts? | 2015-07-23T01:09:03+0000

I'm very impressed, sounds like you have actually already accomplished a lot for your family! This shows that you are quite capable of changing your behavior if you really want to. Have you ever tried other stress reduction techniques like deep breathing and relaxation for example? | 2015-07-23T01:17:37+0000

Who helped you? #motivation | 1 | One of my greatest achievements was getting my scholarship to UMD three years ago. It worked because I work my butt off everyday for it. My parents helped and still help me with my college stuff. | 2015-07-15T23:33:50+0000

Who helped you? #motivation | 2 | Idk if you would consider it a success but here's my story. I moved a few states away from home when I was 14, my parents were trying to get better jobs. 7 years went by and we never went home once to see our family. Then last year my biological father invited me and my brother to come to Colorado with him and we did. After about 6 months there, me and my brother decided to go home(Indiana). I really good friend of ours drove all the way out there and picked us up. Needless to say, seeing my family again for the first time in 8 years(I'm 22 now) was probably one of the best feelings a person could experience, unexplainable. I would have to thank my biological father for this because I was scared of change and he gave me the courage to take a chance at change,ands now because ofthatt, I am finally back home with all my family, right where I belong! | 2015-07-16T01:00:48+0000

Her birth helped me get off bath salts and the weekly visits with her (I'm trying for more) gives me something to look forward to. | 2015-07-16T03:33:37+0000
